    "### Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Hawkeye Hooch, a liquor store owner in Iowa, is looking to expand to new locations and has hired J3 Analytics to create a model to guide them to successful new locations. Hawkeye Hooch is interested in the details of the best model we can fit to the data so that their team can evaluate potential locations for a new storefront.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inspect the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "J3 was provided with an initial data set from the state reflecting liquor transaction for the previous 15 months. While inspecting this data we discovered that the state of Iowa acts as the alcohol wholesaler to stores in the state and that the prices listed in the database as retail were the prices stores paid to the state. There was no retail pricing available for the final transaction (store to consumer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several options presented themselves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume a flat profit margin for all products, essentially making the retail price a proxy for the final transaction price.\n",
    "2. Randomize profit margins.\n",
    "3. Survey market for direction\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to use the first option. #2 would introduce unnecessary and inaccurate complexity and #3 would be costly in terms of time and might not be vital for outcome. #3 will, however, be listed in next steps, as it would be vital for a more accurate read of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed how to use the liquor sales data given we decided that it was insufficient to answer our client’s needs. To suggest what markets should be targeted for new stores it was necessary to know more about the people in those markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to draw demographic, housing, and business information from the Iowa Data Center website. These data were dated with some reflecting information as far back as 2004. Another next step for this project would be to secure current information. They would, however, serve for this initial model.\n",

    "2.\tTo ensure accuracy, we imported a list of Iowa zip codes, cities, counties, county numbers, and zip code areas in square meters from unitedstateszipcodes.org, iowayouthsurvey.iowa.gov/images/iacountiesnumbers.pdf, and 2010 TIGER/ESRI shape files.\n",
    ">* Zip codes required considerable cleaning as there were some zip codes that were not in the state, some that did not exist, and one that was in an unreadable format ( ‘712-2’).\n",
    ">* Using the additional zip code data available to us we were able to identify and correct the majority of these. \n",
    "3.\tAll dollar-based metrics were then converted to floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning was less onerous for the demographic data. Zip codes were converted from strings to integers and symbols and punctuation (',', '%', '$', '-') were removed from cells in order to allow them to be converted to floats.

    "# Personal Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "This was an unusual experience for me as I was working with one person who had programming in his background, albeit not in Python, and another who was very strong in Python while I am still hunting my way through. Basically I had no hope of keeping up with my teammates when it came to coding. That being said, it was an intensely educational experience as I kept reading through their code and taking notes on it. They were very good about walking me through things that I couldn't figure out, too, and I spent some time trying to tinker with what they'd written as well as to try to duplicate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where I felt I was a strong contributor was in designing the strategy, putting on my marketing hat and thinking about what someone would need to know in order to successfully target new locations for a store. This helped us uncover the fact that Iowa is the state wholesaler and that there was no actual retail pricing available to us. I felt strongly that demographics were vital to the project and went out to find data and process it so that it could be brought into the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "While JP and Jocelyn did the heavy lifting code-wise, in the end I felt like I held up my end of things and that I learned more than I might have if I had been as equal a contributor to the coding."
