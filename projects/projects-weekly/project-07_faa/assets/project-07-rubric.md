Data Science Immersive | Project 7						

Your project will be assessed using the following standards, [derived from the data science workflow](../../../../resources/syllabus/DSI-workflow-v1.pdf):

- [ ] Identify Problem
- [ ] Acquire Data
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ] Refine Data		
- [ ] Model Data
- [ ] Present Results
- [ ] *Professional Development*

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

### Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark boxes with 'X' or "n/a" if a section does not apply. Note that "Exceeds Expectations" (3pts) is really only applicable for student writeups or specially marked "*Bonus*" Options.

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identify: Problem Statement + Goals | | | | n/a |
| Acquire: Create Postgres database + Join tables  | | | | n/a |
| Parse: Query Data | | | | n/a |
| Parse: Plot & Describe data  | | | | *Bonus: Include 3-dimensional graph* |
| Mine: Format & Clean data. Describe risks/assumptions. | | | | n/a |
| Refine: Define distribution & correlations | | | | n/a |
| Model: Conduct PCA  | | | | n/a |
| Present: Create blog post: problem, findings, in-depth example, recommendations | | | | |
| *Bonus! Deploy: Push final dataset & model to AWS* | | | | n/a |

- **Section Sub-Score**: __ out of 18 points possible (+2 possible bonus points for using AWS).
