### Overview

Document your work along the way! Write about your analysis as you tune the model for your capstone project and summarize your initial findings.

This "Progress Report" should describe your approach and results, while also documenting any successes, setbacks, and lessons learned along the way.

Include visual and statistical analysis in your progress report, so you can get feedback. Be prepared to meet 1:1 with your instructors to discuss your results so far.

**Goal**: A summative report that describes your progress and includes your initial analysis, results, and any roadblocks or surprises

### Requirements

Your work must:

- Create a "Progress Report" that documents your performance so far:
 - Summarize and refine exploratory data analysis, correlating and plotting data
 - Run model (Train and test subset as needed)
 - Describe initial results and discuss how you intend to evaluate & tune
 - Describe successes, setbacks, & lessons learned along the way.

---

### Necessary Deliverables / Submission

- Preliminary analysis must be submitted in a clearly labeled and easy-to-read Jupyter notebook. Think of it as a hybrid blog post and Jupyter notebook. This notebook should be different from the one where you've done your analysis so far, and should be designed to walk someone through your work. Make sure to include:
 - Markdown cells, code, and visualizations
 - Remove any excess code. 
 - Don't print outputs longer than 5 lines (e.g. dataframes, BeautifulSoup). 
- Materials should be submitted by Thursday of Week 10; 1:1 meetings will occur during Week 11.
