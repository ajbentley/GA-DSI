    "Thus far most of my work has been in the EDA process, though that is somewhat due to the project having a largely descriptive nature. This step in itself has been somewhat fraught with frustrations, many of which are ongoing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel to working on the EDA is an NLP study which will be tapping three different sources, a Slack Group, a Yahoo Group, and my client's website's discussion forums. My big barrier here is that trying to run the data from the Slack group, which is probably the smaller dataset, broke my computer and also won't fit through Github.\n",

So I did all of the cleanup and then exported to csv so that I could then just open it in other notebooks. \n",

    "There have been two big barriers with my EDA. \n",
    "\n",
    "One is that my client didn't tell me until today that they had major changes in the organization in 2007 and 2009 that made any kind of trending including those years disinformative. Unfortunately most of the members from before 2009 were grandfathered into lifetime membership so I couldn't really remove them from any overall observations on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been able to exclude them from yearly trends, though, which has been a blessing...to a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because people are members over a number of years it is necessary for me to isolate who was a member in any given year. I had thought of a very clever way to do this (I thought) which ended up only capturing the first year of membership. I was then able to write (with help from Stack Overflow (and man do some folks get their hackles up when you tell them what they suggested doesn't work!)) code that isolated membership in every year except for 2016. That one is still eluding me and is basically the barrier to my completing this portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has been especially frustrating because I have twice now thought that the issue was resolved, moved forward with analysis and visualizing, and then realized I needed to go back to the drawing board. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also decided a few days ago to stop banging my head against walls of visualizations that I can't get right in Python and just do them in Excel. I'll get back around to learning how to do them in Python later, but I've got to keep an eye on the deadline too much now to be a purist about such things.\n",
