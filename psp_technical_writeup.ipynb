    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Park Slope Parents, a networking and peer support group for parents living in and around the Park Slope Neighborhood of Brooklyn has seen a flattening of membership and was interested in better understanding when families joined and left the group. Specifically they had these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When do people typically join PPP relative to their children’s birth dates?\n",
    "* When do people typically let membership lapse?\n",
    "* What is the average length of membership?\n",
    "* Is there seasonality associated with membership?\n",
    "* How have membership levels changed over the years?\n",
    "* How has the group’s reach changed over the years?\n",
    "* How can we continue to grow?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "My goal is to address these questions in five phases. The first two are covered in this paper while the remaining phases will be addressed in the future and are beyond the client's initial scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase I: Descriptive Analysis\n",
    "Phase II: Modelling Long Term versus Short Term membership\n",
    "Phase III: NLP\n",
    "Phase IV: Demographic shifts in Brooklyn for marketing efforts\n",
    "Phase V: Membership price analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase I: Descriptive Analysis\n",
    "After removing open-response fields (address and reasons for joining the group), which I felt would be more useful in future phases, I dummied out several groups that had string responses where int would be more useful in analysis, then deleted the original column of data. Where the answers were binary (e.g., Yes/No, male/female) I deleted the negative value of the pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to take this route with the binary response columns rather than converting the responses to 0 and 1 because it seemed clearer code, though perhaps less \"Pythonic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I added columns for the month and year a member joined, the member's first child was born, and the member's second child was born (if only one child repeated first child's month and year. I created a new column for the year the membership lapsed. While doing this I discovered several outliers. Some were the result of input error without the system throwing up an exception. This resulted in children reported as having been born in the year 2 (002) ranther than 2002 (2002 or 02). \n",
    "\n",
    "More difficult to identify and work around were situations where grandparents would join the organization and when they were asked for their childen's birthdays would answer accuratly, meaning they would give their childen's birthdays and not their grandchildren's birthdays. In order to account for this I limited the study to members who had children whose birthdays were between 1995 - 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first round of EDA was histograms taken directly from the data on month joined, number of children, birth patterns by month, how the group was discovered, and membership type (options were available for 1, 2, 5, and lifetime memberships). Most visualizations are plot.ly initiated in python and then cleaned in plot.ly workshop. Stacked 100% cylander charts (or, as the client calls them, Smartees charts) were made in Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Descriptive Analysis Observations and Visualizations\n",
    "Code here was fairly straighforward and is provided following the write-up. All plot.ly code is commented out as it requires sign-in to run and my credentials have not been provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 1. When do families join? **\n",
    "Typically membership is fairly even through the year with November and December lagging as the lowest months for new members joining. Perhaps because of these softer numbers January tends to be stronger than most for new families.\n",
    "\n",
    "New families also seem to join in the summer months. According to PPP this is largely for nanny recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This year the summer swell was unusually strong as nearly half of the year's new families joined between May and July.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** 2. How many children do PPP families have? **\n",
    "Most families have had only one child, but the number of two children families has been very strong as well. I had been toying with the idea of just using 1-child families since that would be easier for some comparisons, but that is clearly not an option here. The good news is that there are very few 3+ families so the fact that we don't have birth dates past #2 is less of an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the original distribution for this feature included a \"more than four\" category. There were few enough families of that category that I merged them with the 4 (to make 4+)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally the 0.5 column is for families who had a child on the way, through pregnancy or adoption, but were not yet parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean number of children for Parkside Parenting Partnership families has been 1.37\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** 3. When are members' children born? **\n",
    "Birth patterns are very similar for first and second children, never more than 50 children between number born in each month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, this does not mean that individual families have children in the same month, just that overall patterns are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is laregly here for the benefit of the client and has a considerable bias as when there was no second child the first child's birthdate is used. Regardless, there are enough second children that a more apparent discrepency should be seen if it was somehow different.\n",

    "Interestingly, the trend of searches for the group as reported by Google are very different than the responses from families joining PPP.

    "In terms of percent of all families, 1-year memberships have been on a slow decline over the years with 2-year memberships on the rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "When she found out about this the client let me know that she is interested in looking into whether the price point for 2 year memberships is costing the organization more money than it would lose by having only 1 year memberships available.

    "Looking just at members who show a join date at most 12 years before the child's arrival or less than 2 years prior, we can see that the average (median) member joins about 5 months after their first child is born. This average includes people who join before their children are due.\n",
    "\n",
    "About 2/3 of members join after their children arrived.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these members the average join date is 22 months old. That means that half of members who join after their children have arrived do so after age 22 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1st quartile in this measurement, the 25% earliest joins post arrival, was at 4.5 months old. That is a large drop-off and presents a potential target for membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among members who join before their children arrive, they do so 3.6 months before the arrival. The 1st quartile here is 5.3 months so there isn't as much opportunity to reach out here.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](https://ajbentley.github.io/assets/images/psp/psp_joinvbirth.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time we can see that it has become more and more popular for people to join PPP while they are still waiting for their child to be born or adopted, representing over half of the members joining in 2016.\n",

    "Looking only at expired memberships, they tend to last about 22 months after their second child was born (if applicable--if not then 1st child birth date was used).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a _very_ interesting number as it is also the median age at which new members join (join date versus 1st child's birth). This suggests there may be a \"ships in the night\" pattern and makes it doubly important that Parenting Network concentrates on either increasing or emphasizing value for parents of children under 2 years old in order to both retain membership past this age and to bring parents in a little sooner.\n",
