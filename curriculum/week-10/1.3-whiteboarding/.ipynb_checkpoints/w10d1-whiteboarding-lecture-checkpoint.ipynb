If you don't know the best way to do something, what would you do on the job? You'd probably Google it. Tell the interviewer this. It doesn't make you look weak, it shows that you are realistic about the work you'll do.\n",

    "- Bottlenecks: a part of the algorithm where work is done repeatedly, or done once but inefficiently.\n",
