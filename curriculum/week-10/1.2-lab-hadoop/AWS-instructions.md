Instructors: This week requires some additional preparation. In order to complete the lessons and labs on AWS without running up a bill, students will need access to their AWS educational credits. Instructions for this are as follows:

## Part 1: Assign Individual Signup Forms
1. [Open the following spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/spreadsheets/d/10NX8X9SACz7q5xUmZxJ6y-4lVlUnlkU28FOGzL0juJ4/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Navigate to the tab with your market.
3. Review the URLs available (in green). If no URLs are available, alert your local production team.
4. Assign a unique URL code for each of your students. Highlight the ones you’ve assigned in red.
5. Send these URLs to your students via Slack or Email. These URLs should be unique to each student, so don't share them among multiple people.

## Part 2: Sign Up For & Confirm AWS Accounts
These URLs will take students to an input form. To complete this form, students will need to:

1. Use "GA-Data-Science" under the Institution Name (this should be pre-filled out)
2. Enter your name & location.
3. Ignore the disclaimer on email; you can use your personal (or any amazon associated) email address here.
4. Choose whatever you want for "field of study" & "grade level"
5. For "graduation month/year", please enter the last day of our current GA DSI cohort.
6. Enter your AWS account ID - if you know it! If so, proceed to step 9. If not, see below.
  - *Note: This is a 12 digit number, not your Amazon username (if you have one).*
7. If you don't know it or have never signed up for AWS before, click the link to "sign up now". This will open in a new tab.
8. Once you sign up and enter the AWS console, you can click on your name (on the top right) to view your account and copy your AWS account ID. Copy / paste that back into the form.
9. On the next page, you will need to input your credit card information. Don't worry, it won't be charged!
10. Select "basic support plan".
11. Submit. You should have now an email that says you’re "under review".
12. You will then receive a second confirmation email from `support@awseducate.com` and your credits will be linked to your AWS account.

**REMINDER**: Make sure to check your spam folder for the review and confirmation email from "support@awseducate.com".

***If you have any problems, please alert your local production team.***
