### Kaggle has just released a new challenge on time series data and this morning your challenge is to do the following

1. If you have not already done so, sign up for [kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com)
2. Sign up for the [Two Sigma Financial Modeling Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-modeling)
3. This challenge uses a new format that is similar to the type of  isolated virtual environments we've been working with this week, but in this case, they are hosted on Kaggle. Spend some time going through the tutorials to understand how these work and how to work in them with the data
4. Start your initial EDA of the data 
5. Start thinking about how working with time series data might differ from working with other types of data
6. Begin engineering features
7. If you get far enough and feel comfortable doing so, submit your first attempt
