It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.

Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\\nstrong response from the West was required.\\n\\n\\nWell, it\\'s not very \"loving\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up\\nnearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass\\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.

It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.\\nAnd frankly, the original \"not guilty\" verdict baffled me too.  But then\\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it\\'s evident that \\nthe first jury decided that the officers were \"not guilty\".  Note, \\nnot \"not guilty\" of doing wrong, but \"not guilty\" of aggravated assault \\nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the \\nprosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a \\nverdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.\\n\\nIf the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then\\nI feel the \"not guilty\" verdict was a reasonable one.\\n\\n\\nThanks mathew, I like the quote.

In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn\\'t she the cutest thing!?\"\\n\\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\\nit is not.\\n\\n\\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\\nJohn E King:\\n\\n\\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\\nbe rebuilt\", and you\\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\\nto get from `fishing nets\\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\\n\\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit is hardly a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, no.  That\\'s only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I\\'m\\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\\nit\\'s at least a two-horse town.\\n\\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it\\'s still 22,000 people\\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\\n\\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwalls.\\n\\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\\n', u'About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\\narea.', u\"I need the file format for cc:Mail file formats - it seems to be PCX-based,\\nbut with a twist: only the first page of a multi-page fax will come out\\nreadable.

Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

As his guilt has not been established, it is\\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\\n\\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \\ndistinction.\\n\\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \\noutwardly profess\\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\\n\\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true\\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is\\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\\nwill not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By\\n\"Muslim\" we do not necessarily mean \"Mu\\'min\", or \"true believer\" in\\nIslam.', u\"\\nI will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for \\nthe Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to\\nall people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\\nHeaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\\nobsolete by Jesus.\\n\\nIf anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\\nfollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\\nthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He\\nalso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived\\ninterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their\\nheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness\\nmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom\\nof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their\\nway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.\\nThey had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the\\nletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  \\n\\nI think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\\nmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\\nin it.

Literally. There is\\n     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible\\n     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\\n\\n          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the \\n          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];\\n          (Matthew 13:38)\\n\\n          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which \\n          ye have seen with your father.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"', u'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\\nNero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?   Their documents\\nhave decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse? \\n\\n\\nPeter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what\\nthe Bible says.   \\n\\n\\nConsider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of\\nyears, various people come up and testify of their experience with the\\nliving God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,\\nonce the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes\\nDavid, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King \\nNebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes\\nNehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent\\ntakes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use\\nto kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up\\ncomes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.\\nUp comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS\\nagents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years\\nwith people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself\\n\"I am.\" \\n\\nWhile you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that\\nKing David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known\\nMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these\\npeople are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet\\nall of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells\\nof his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is\\ndifferent, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly\\nreveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.\\nWhat Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of\\nBabylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different\\nperspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\\ndares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness\\'s\\ntestimony, even though different from those prior, consistently\\ndescribes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  \\n\\nNow.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic\\non the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  \"I am\".  He has\\nrevealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).\\nPlease believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.', u\"\\n\\nEven worse, the city of Atlanta has a proposal before it to rent space on this\\norbiting billboard.  Considering the caliber of people running this city, \\nthere's no telling what we're going to have leering down at us from orbit.\", u\"All of this talk about a COMMERCIAL space race (i.e. $1G to the first 1-year \\nmoon base) is intriguing. Similar prizes have influenced aerospace \\ndevelopment before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of \\nSaint Louis venture to his financial backers.\\n\\nIf memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally \\nreimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as \\nFokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh \\nultimately kept his total costs below that amount.\\n\\nBut I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to \\nrealize that much more was at stake than $25,000.\\n\\nCould it work with the moon?

Hiermee ontstond de tweede\\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\\n\\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\\nvieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala\\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\\n\\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\\n'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\\neen apart vel.\\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde.

Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed\\ngaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht\\nWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen\\nhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van\\neen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,\\nin de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.\\nProf. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel\\nopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en\\ntrachten te verklaren.\\nHet slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de\\ntechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn\\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\\n\\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

This is nice, but...\\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\\ntitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are\\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\\nbasalts.

I'm the first\\nthat connected Osiris with a virtual reality personality database.\\nTime to write a book.\\n\\n\\nCheers,\\nKent\", u\"[why do babies get diseases, etc.]\\n\\n Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably \\nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\\nhow could it exist before humans?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'\\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\\ncollective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the\\ndegeneration of the genetic code'.\\n\\n\\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to\\nbe getting less nasty w/age...\\n\\n\\n Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n\\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system\\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the\\noriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in\\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\\nof did It just choose not to?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for\\nthe explanation you give. (At least, that I'm aware of.)

Abstracts of \\nthe articles are appended. \\n\\n\\n    This leads to the more general question: do yet other people than \\nthe US, Russia, and Japan do space surveillance, and if so, how and \\nwhy? \\n\\nAllen Thomson              SAIC                        McLean, VA, USA\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                         ABSTRACTS\\n\\nOptical tracking of the experimental geodetic satellite (EGS)\\nTAKABE, MASAO; ITABE, TOSHIKAZU; ARUGA, TADASHI\\nRadio Research Laboratory, Review (ISSN 0033-801X), vol. 34,\\nMarch 1988, p. 23-34.

The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an\\noutline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <----\\nstation are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical\\nequipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit\\nprediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS\\ntracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also\\ndiscussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the\\nposition of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which was\\nlaunched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <----\\nsatellite tracking video. It is clear from this experiment that     <----\\noptical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very  <----\\nuseful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      <----\\nstages.

Radio Atmospheric Science Center.\\nIn International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.\\nHandbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p\\nPublication Date: Jun. 1986\\n      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere \\ntroposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar \\nfeatures an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \\nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \\nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \\nand results are discussed.\\n\", u'-*----\\n\\nThe two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are\\nso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael\\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\\n \\n\\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\\nloving one\\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and\\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \\n\\n\\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \\n\\n\\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \\n\\n\\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \\n\\n-*----\\n\\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \\nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\\ngospel.\\n\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\\nmake Michael\\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\\nlukewarm we should spit out.

If plasma\\n\\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\\n\\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\\n\\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\\n\\t    other special applications would be at hand.

Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with\\n  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something\\n  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\\n\\n  Jay\\n\\nand again:\\n\\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\\n\\njay\", u'\\nWishful thinking mostly. It\\'s more likely that the Moon will never\\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\\nmaterials we can\\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \\nand it\\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\\'s heat \\nsink capacity could offer some military utility for \"high ground\" military\\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \\ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \\nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\\'s a very minor \\nactivity in the global scope of things.\\n\\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\\'s likely too low to prevent\\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\\'s\\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\\n\\nWe don\\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\\'s because we don\\'t have to\\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\\'ll use the\\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\\ncenturies, if not much longer.\\n\\nLuna\\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\\nconventional warfare again. There\\'s little glory in watching from a\\nbunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little\\nultimate profit either.\\n\\nGary', u'\\n\\nLet us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by\\nsentence.\\n\\n\\n1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.\\n\\nOrigins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\\n\\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\\n\\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\\non what origins we are talking about.\\n\\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\\n\\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \\n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\\n\\nMore to the point, restricting one\\'s discussion of origins to science\\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\\nscope of discussion.\\n\\n4) This is a false premise.\\n\\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\\n\\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God\\'s creation.\\n\\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\\n\\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\\n\\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\\nwith the following contextual modification:\\n\\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.', u'\\nThat\\'s a typical claim, though they say they\\'ve improved\\ncompression speed considerably.

I\\'d be interested in looking at it if you could give me\\nany pointers.\\n\\nReportedly, early fractal compression times of 24-100 hours used\\nthat marvelous piece of hardware called \"grad students\" to do the\\nwork.

Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3.

Returned soil samples in\\n\\t      1976.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\\n\\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\\n\\t       lost enroute in 1961.\\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\\n\\t       VENERA 3.

No images were returned.\\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\\n\\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\\n\\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\\n\\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\\n\\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\\n\\t       similar in 1969.\\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\\n\\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\\n\\t       1972.\\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\\n\\t       first probe to orbit Venus.

Flyby buses went on\\n\\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\\n\\t     March of 1986.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\\n\\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\\n\\t     enroute the following year.\\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\\n\\t     Planet in 1971.\\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\\n\\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\\n\\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\\n\\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\\n\\t     probe MARINER 9.\\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\\n\\t     with its flyby bus.\\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\\' largest\\n\\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\\n\\t       human/computer error.\\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\\n    public and university library.

TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major\\n    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,\\n    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events\\n    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are\\n    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you\\n    probably know.\\n\\n    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you\\n    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space\\n    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration.

They still arm themselves to \"defend the\\n#>faith\", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a\\n#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives\\n#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their\\n#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.\\n#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy \"they,\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when\\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most of\\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"\\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like it\\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\\nappears, those of David Koresh.\\n\\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They\\'re pledged to defend\\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\\n\\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\\n\\n#\\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I\\'m taking it with a salt block.\\n\\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\\n\\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI\\'s treatment\\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\\n\\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\\nof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in the\\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\\n\\n#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\\n\\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon\\'s \"orders\" (the late\\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\\nopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile maze\\nin Utah).\\n\\n#        That\\'s my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have\\n#splinter groups that don\\'t mirror the masses, but these are small\\n#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.\\n#\\n#        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.  When a\\n#man\\'s religion is used to deny him the right of self-protection with\\n#the weapons suitable for the job, he\\'ll find an ally in me.\\n#\\n#< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\\n#<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.

It\\'s not high priority; nobody\\ntakes it very seriously.  The shadowed half of the face does not look very\\nface-like, so all it will take is one shot at a different sun angle to ruin\\nthe illusion.', u'  I found it very interesting that Atlas depended on pressure to\\nmaintain tank geometry....leads me to the question: ? have any \\nof the SSTO concepts explored pressurized tankage such that the\\nlaunch configuration would be significantly different from the\\nreentry one?  I have long been facinated by pnumatic structures\\nas conceived and built by Frei Otto and others, a \"ballon\" tank\\nSSTO sounds very clever. \\n\\n', u'I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or\\nTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted\\nby a 3D scanline renderer. \\n\\nI have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but\\nhave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\\nsubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.\\n\\nThanks for any pointers.\\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n', u'Jesus:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlack and white.

Jesus is not soloing you out.\\nJesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.\\nChristians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian \\nis just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian \\ncan see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought\\nout into the light.

If you haven\\'t\\nseen Jesus\\'s light, your evil deeds simply haven\\'t been\\nexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your\\nown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.

I wonder where #2 is?', u'But he said,\\n\\tYea rather,\\n\\tblessed are they\\n\\tthat hear the word of God,\\n\\tand keep it.', u'The primary problem in human nature is a \"fragmentation of being.\"\\nHumans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and\\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\\n\\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\\'s\\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\\nthe Scriptures.\\n\\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\\n\\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\\n\\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\\n\\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\\n\\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\\n\\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\\n\\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it\\nwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the\\nanswer to his dilemma in vs 25.', u\"\\nI haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) \\nwas planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost\\npayload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from\\n2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing\\nwith the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now\\nI recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the \\nsuccessor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early\\nresults are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in \\nRussia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue \\ntheir development. \\n\\nThe Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton \\nis 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D\\nwhich sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about\\nlaunch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which\\nare probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things\\nup pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile\\nthing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.\\nProtons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know \\nhow much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while\\nbolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track\\nand erected on the pad?  \\n\\nThey would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads \\n(unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course\\nany Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the\\nUS at great cost.

(Due to the prevailing assumption \\nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\\n\\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \\ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \\nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\\n\\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\\n\\n  \\n1\\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\\n \\n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \\nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \\nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \\n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\\n\\n  The earth isn\\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \\nof a galaxy; we haven\\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \\nbeing stationary, and the sun\\'s image being dragged across the sky by \\nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \\nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \\nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \\nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \\nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \\nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\\n  \\n  The moon isn\\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \\nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\\'s ether field, which is \\nitself in the sun\\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \\nwobble of earth\\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\\' images being dragged around\\nby the sun\\'s ether feild.\\n\\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \\napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \\nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon\\'s lattice in the ether is like \\nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \\nturn. The sun\\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \\ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \\nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \\nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \\nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \\n\\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \\ncan be about as big as \"earth\\'s\" shadow upon it, and at other times \\ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \\nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \\nlook about the same size?\\n\\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\\n E       /     \\\\            \\n    M    |      |      OR                M    \\n         \\\\ _ _ /                         \\n       S                           \\n       \\n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\\nof ether spins.

( I\\'ve seen a \\nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \\nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon\\'s image \\nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \\nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \\nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\\n\\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \\ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \\nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \\n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \\nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \\nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\\n\\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \\nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \\na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \\ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\\n\\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\\'d \\nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \\nmight carry decipherable data. I\\'d start looking on some part of the \\nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \\nbillion humans?) I\\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \\nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \\nfor Pentium!)\\n\\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \\nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \\nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \\nI\\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \\n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \\ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \\ncould get with my machine\\'s receiver next to it.  \\n\\n  If you don\\'t think you\\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \\nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY!

The dark one was in the process of making the \\nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \\n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \\nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \\nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \\nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \\nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \\ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \\nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \\nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \\nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \\nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \\nseemed odd, but we couldn\\'t remember how else it should be. Then \\nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \\nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \\nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \\nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \\nexisting only on the wind. \\n\\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \\nwhose will\\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \\nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \\nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \\nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\\'s more than one way back) \\n\\n Accepting rides to the past:\\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \\nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \\nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \\nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \\nyour work, but thinks you\\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \\npaths with your old self, and you\\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \\ncourse of history, none the wiser.\\n\\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \\nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \\nmake changes while he\\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \\nevery \\'adjustment\\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \\nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \\nBut he can\\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \\nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \\nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \\n\\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \\nour money, and they\\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \\nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \\ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \\nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \\ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \\nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \\nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \\nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \\nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \\nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \\nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \\n\\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \\nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \\nable to control.\\n\\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \\nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \\nlanguage. (telepathic; and \\'vanishing\\' the closest knowledge of death)\\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \\npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \\nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \\nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \\nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \\nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \\ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\\'t eating seeds.\\n\\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \\nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \\nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \\nneed a lot less sleep.\\n\\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \\ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf.

I don\\'t think his arguments warrant the use of a \"Therefore...\"\\n\\n\\nThis is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with\\npeople result in - quoting the bible.

The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.', u'\\nIs it right???

So long as it accurately predicts or \\ndescribes things we can observe.\\n\\nNot to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't\\njust say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution\\nis still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started\\nbecause I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,\\nbasically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a \\nclarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of\\nevolution_ has a very different meaning to me.\\n\\nI'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger\\nabout separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_\\nproposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves\\nare the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not \\nthe things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered \\nfact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle \\nsystems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original \\npoint, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only \\nthe mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_\\natoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough\\nto discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being \\nany clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.\\n\\nThe bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:\\n\\n   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)\\n      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational\\n        evidence (your way)\\n\\n   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it\\n        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence \\n\\tand it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can\\n        be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't\\n\\tmuch to say.\\n\\nDo you agree?\\n\", u\"\\nWell, there are two approaches we can take here.  One is to ask you what this\\nobjective morality is, assuming it's not a secret.\\n\\nThe other is to ask you what you think is wrong with relativism, so that we\\ncan correct your misconceptions :-)\\n\", u\"thus\\n\\nCuriously, in modern PostScript, the point in a polygon problem can\\nbe solved even more easily.

When the man abandons, the woman\\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\\n\\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \"My\\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\"\\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\\nIt\\'s the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\\ndemons for all of eternity.

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \\nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \\nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\\'ll be \\nglad to.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \\ndisagree - it\\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling.

Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler', u'Every time you read about a shuttle landing they mention the double sonic  \\nbooms.

When work for a large program like\\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\\n   billion won\\'t be spent on anything having anything\\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\\'t), but the work done\\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\\n   term \\'center tax\\'. They look at the Station they are\\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\\n   it doesn\\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\\n\\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\\'t post a\\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I\\'m supposed\\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \\nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\\n\\nFirst off, yes, the concept of \\'center tax\\', or \\'wrap\\' does\\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \\'tax\\'\\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\\ncenter \\'taxes\\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\\n\\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\\nwill concede it\\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket\\nchange.\\n\\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\\'t if you get it\\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\\nsubject to the center tax (I don\\'t have the numbers in\\nfront of me, but I\\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\\nrate of 1/3, but it\\'s only applied to funds spent at the\\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\\n\\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\\ndoing with SSF funds that don\\'t go to the prime contractors?\\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\\'t eaten\\nup by the center tax?)\"\\n\\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\\nof the power system.\\n\\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\\n\\nAs a final example, my \\'home\\' division at Lewis used\\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \\ndatabase with information on weight of the power\\nsystem elements).\\n\\nFinally, the money raised by the \\'tax\\' does not all\\ngo into a \\'slush fund.\\' At Lewis, the director\\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\\n\\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \\'general\\'\\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \\ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \\nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\\nSSF budget doesn\\'t go for SSF activities. To get\\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\\n1 year is \\'billable\\' to SSF, would you base it on\\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\\na burecratic nightmare!', u\"  Bingo.\\n Nothing evil at all.

The \\ncopier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\\nprinter with the \"lp\" system using the parallel interface and can print \\npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \\nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \\npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \\nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \\nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \\nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \\nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \\nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\\nand translating the image into postscript.\\n\\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \\npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \\nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \\nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \\nsome assurance that the product will work.\\n\\n\\nHere my questions:\\n\\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \\nparallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?\\n\\nIs there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the\\nlimiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on \\nthe printer?\\n \\nThe Big question:\\n\\nWhere can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease email directly to me, I don\\'t not read news on a regular basis. \\nI will post a summary.\\n\\nThanks in advance.\\n', u\" \\n(Deletion)\\n \\nNo cookies, Charlie.

People will hate who\\nthey will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or\\nhammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it\\'s\\nstill a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also\\nbecause people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he\\nhad wrought.\\n\\n\\nFirst, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not\\nsway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?\\n\\nOne of the big reasons is that many, many people want something\\nbeyond this life.  You can pretend that they don\\'t want this, but I for\\none can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.\\n\\nAnd there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God.\\nCan love as a truth be proven, logically?\\n\\n\\n\\nJohn the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see\\nhow that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast\\nin this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,\\nI do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,\\nyou might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,\\nJesus, for instance.\\n\\n\\nI speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence\\nsupporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supporting\\nlove as truth is subjective.\\n\\n\\nNo apology necessary.  :)\\n--\\nBake Timmons, III', u'The Harvard Computer Society is pleased to announce its third lecture of\\nthe spring.

You see,\\nwhat one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.\\n\\n\\nAgain, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of \"worth\"\\nis subjective. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of\\nthat word given by another person, I try to find a standard against\\nwhich to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard\\nI use. Here is a definiton of objective:\\n\\nobjective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \\ndistinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance.\\n3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\\nobservable phenomenon.\\n\\nBy this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the\\nphrase \"objective worth\" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a \\nlittle differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a\\nnotion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is\\nresponsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and\\nthus \"objective\") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.\\nHowever, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is \\n\"good\") is subjective.\\n\\nI think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time\\nand read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth,\\nvalue, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the \\nmeaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no\\nsuch thing as an objective morality.\\n', u\"\\nAs I heard the story, before Albert came up the the theory\\no'relativity and warped space, nobody could account for\\nMercury's orbit.

There is no planet inside of\\nthe orbit of Mercury.\\n\\nThe idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury\\'s observed\\nperihelion precession and the value it should have had according to\\nNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations\\nand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later\\nimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier\\'s system\\nof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\\nafoot with Mercury.\\n\\nBut alas, \\'twere not so.  Mercury\\'s perihelion precesses at the rate\\nit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly\\ncurved due to the sun\\'s mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915\\nand Albert Einstein\\'s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics\\nof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian \\ngeometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of\\nit\\'s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession\\nof Mercury\\'s perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb\\'s\\nnumbers rather than Leverrier\\'s.)\\n\\nOf course not everybody believes Einstein, and that\\'s fine.  But subsequent\\nefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar\\nhave been fruitless.\\n\\n-Bill Gawne\\n\\n \"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe\\n  are the laws of the universe.\"                       - G.

If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\\ncontent;  \\'One ought always to do the right thing\\' is plainly true in\\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\\naction (see analytic and synthetic).

Now I\\'d like to describe it in detail:\\n\\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\\nWhy not an ellipse?

In fact, for the Bible to be of\\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\\n\\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\\nwritten down by man.\\n\\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\\nhave done).\\n\\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\\nthink the important aspect is the result.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:', u\"\\nA very good modeling package I found is `irit' (look for irit.tar.Z).\\nHowever there is no converter from it's format to POV format.

A person who commits himself  \\nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \\nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\\n\\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \\nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\\n\\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\\n\\n\\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\\n\\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd in John 3:16:\\n\\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\\n   life.\"\\n\\n\\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn\\'t be posting\\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God\\'s church.\\n\\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\\n\\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \\nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\\nhe did with full heart.

There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master \\n          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, \\n          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and \\n          after the life of Jesus. \\n    \\n               The followers of some of these Masters founded the \\n          world\\'s major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of \\n          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added \\n          THREATS of \"ETERNAL DAMNATION\" in Hell, and DELETED the \\n          teaching of REincarnation. \\n       \\n               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular \\n          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is \\n          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively \\n          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY \\n          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \\n          UNIVERSES.)                             \\n\\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \\n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \\n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \\n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \\n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \\n      \\n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \\n          indicator for religious validity. \\n    \\n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \\n          other major world religions, including Islam. \\n     \\n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \\n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \\n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \\n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \\n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \\n          \"silver cord\". \\n    \\n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul\\'s cycles of \\n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \\n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \\n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \\n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \\n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \\n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \\n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \\n    \\n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \\n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \\n          Mat\" organization. \\n      \\n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \\n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \\n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \\n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \\n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \\n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \\n    \\n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \\n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \\n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \\n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \\n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \\n          classic. \\n    \\n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \\n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \\n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \\n          don\\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \\n          Jesus was. \\n    \\n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \\n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \\n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \\n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \\n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n          \\n    \\n          RE-INCARNATION\\n          \\n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \\n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \\n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \\n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \\n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \\n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \\n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \\n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \\n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \\n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \\n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \\n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \\n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \\n          \\n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \\n          typically originate from a person\\'s PAST LIVES.  For example, \\n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \\n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \\n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \\n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \\n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \\n          INCARNATION. \\n\\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \\n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \\n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \\n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \\n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \\n\\n\\n\\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\\n\\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \\n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \\n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \\n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \\n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \\n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \\n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \\n          waiting for Jesus\\' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \\n    \\n          \\n          \\n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\\n\\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \\n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \\n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \\n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \\n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \\n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \\n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \\n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \\n    \\n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \\n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \\n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \\n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \\n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \\n    \\n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \\n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \\n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \\n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \\n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \\n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \\n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \\n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\\n\\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \\n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \\n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \\n       \\n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \\n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \\n          CONTINUE. \\n    \\n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \\n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \\n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \\n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \\n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \\n          a Member.

', u'\\nThe number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and \\nexploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The\\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \\nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\\n\\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\\nEither the smart bombs didn\\'t hit their targets (and we know they did),\\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\\ndestroying Iraq\\'s military potential.  The military mission planners are\\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\\ntyrant-dictator. \\n\\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\\nI don\\'t hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\\nwith smart bombs, it\\'s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That\\'s war the way it really is.\\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\\nlike it\\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\\nwishes to stay free.   \\n\\n\\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\\n\\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I\\'m sure that appeasement would have\\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\\nshouldn\\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \\nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \\nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you\\'d be speaking\\nGerman instead of English right now.\\n\\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\\'t understand\\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\\nthat Bush wimped out and didn\\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so\\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\\'s sacrifice (not to\\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \\nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\\'ve been better!\\n\\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \\n\\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\\na reasonable doubt of one\\'s guilt, and only the jury is in a position\\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply\\nsuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.\\n       \\nRegards,', u\"I searched the U Mich archives fairly thoroughly for 3D graphics packages,\\nI always thought it to be a mirror of sumex-aim.stanford.edu...

Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \\nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \\nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \\nthe histories I\\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \\nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \\nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \\nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \\n1920\\'s.\\n\\n\\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \\nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\\'ve read), I\\'d like to know \\nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \\nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\\'t you write them \\nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\\'t tell from \\ntheir footnotes? I\\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\\'m not going to waste my time\\ntrying to debunk someone\\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\\n\\n\\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\\nconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been\\nconsidered \"shrewd guesses\"?\\n\\nI suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -\\nhistorians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious \\nfootnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually \\nprovide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place \\nto start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.\\n\\nI\\'ll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\\npurposes.\\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\\ninformation\\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\\na\\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\\n \\nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\\nand\\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\\ninterfacing\\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\\nthe\\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\\nfacility\\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\\nconstruction\\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\\nby the users themselves.\\n \\nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\\n - art and theater\\n - bbs and online network users\\n - software and game developers\\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\\n - children\\n - the child in all of us\\n \\nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\\n \\nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\\nmachine-lets.\\n \\n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\\n \\n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\\n \\nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\\ndata link to LTM1.\\n \\nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\\nSSTO\\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\\nlandscape and land.\\n \\nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\\nworldwide\\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\\ncommercially\\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\\n \\nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\\n \\nPLAN OF ACTION:\\n \\nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\\'s. A press release will be\\nissued\\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\\nmodels\\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\\n \\nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\\nbe\\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\\ntime\\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\\nto\\ntheir campus.\\n \\nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\\nwill\\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\\n \\nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\\nexperimentation\\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\\nlong\\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\\n \\nCONCLUSION:\\n \\nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\\nreal\\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\\'s minds in\\nspace.\\n \\n \\nMOONLIGHTERS:\\n \\n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\\n \\nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\\n \\nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

There are books out there which explain\\neverything, and the basic 3D functions, translation, rotation, shading, and\\nhidden line removal are pretty easy.  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht\\nhe help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source.\\n\\tAlso, Quickdraw has a lot of 3D functions built in, and Think pascal\\ncan access them, and I would expect that THINK C could as well.

I\\nheard that there is a beer drinking ghost who still haunts the place!  8-{)\\n\\nTom\\n\\nI liked this one I read a while ago...', u'I have seen several ray-traced scenes (from MTV or was it \\nRayShade??) with stroked fonts appearing as objects in the image.\\nThe fonts/chars had color, depth and even textures associated with\\nthem.  Now I was wondering, is it possible to do the same in POV??\\n\\n\\nThanks,', u'\\nNo.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible\\nnear-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those\\ndiscussions, a\\nspacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to \\nsome entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with\\nit.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on \\nthe sensors that might be carried.\\n\\nActually, that sounds unlikely.  I don\\'t know what the launch vehicle\\nwould be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --\\ncertainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA\\nfor, e.g.,  launch support would probably \\ncover NASA\\'s incremental costs pretty well.\\n\\n\\nNo, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per \\nClementine and related programs.  I\\'m sure folks around here would like to \\nsee a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, \\nthe U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure\\nwould not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was\\n(or a parade balloon, for that matter).\\n\\nWhile I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I\\'ve got\\na background in astronomy, it\\'s hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived\\nintrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting\\nonly a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly\\ndraw attention to space.   \\n\\nWhich, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.\\n\\n\\nAs far as I know, it\\'s a purely commercial venture.\\n\\nI gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.\\nCommercial projects, however, generally don\\'t get \"funding\" -- they\\nget \"customers\" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.\\n\\nNahh.

This\\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\\nparticipants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in\\nSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by\\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\\n\\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\\n       examples.\\n\\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.\\n\\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\\n\\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\\nworld\\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\\n\\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\\nof the world\\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\\norganisation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\\nEUTELSAT.', u'The home office number for ENVIRONET is (301) 286-5690 (note area\\ncode change).

But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some \\nreferences.  See Robin Lane Fox\\'s _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where \\nLane Fox writes, \"... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus\\' \\ncareer] is agreed to be a Christian addition.\"\\n\\nIn my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21\\nApril 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine \\nPagel\\'s _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  \"A comment *attributed* to\\nJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]\".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\\n\\nSo far as I can deduce, today\\'s consensus is built on at least three things: \\n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \\nI don\\'t know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\\norginally developed (does anyone?).\\n\\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The\\nformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and\\nideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I \\ndidn\\'t elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to\\nincorporate theology).\\n\\nCan\\'t say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before \\nGutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one \\nhand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,\\nbecause anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is \\ncertainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have \\nthe two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic \\nms.  But here the ms. date is critical.\\n\\n:-)', u'\\nYou totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen.

This is simply an ad hominum\\nattack and you know it.\\n\\n\\nOf course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any\\norganization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate\\ncosts, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support\\na program and \"wrap\" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap\\nwas on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you\\nsay is not true. Which is it Allen?\\n\\n\\nAs you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and\\nabove overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.\\nNasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some\\nnumbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then\\nhowl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.\\n\\n\\nIntegration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was \\ndone here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of\\nReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are\\ncompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There\\nis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project\\nthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for \\nApollo?\\n\\n\\nOh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.\\nThey should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it\\nreplaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your\\nbias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just\\nhow wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what\\nthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. \\n\\n\\nI agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful\\nlarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that\\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\\n\\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\\nefforts that you do not see this.\\n\\n\\nNo, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have \\nhappened in the first place.\\n\\nI have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is\\nat reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally\\nignoring the lack of leadership of congress.

Numerous studies claim that even in\\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\\n\\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\\n    pursue are:\\n\\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\\n    Salisbury in \"Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\\n    Controversy,\" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

Studies\\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\\n    study, Charles Jackman.\\n\\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\\n\\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\\n\\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Shuttle sources:\\t  725,000 kilograms/year\\n\\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\\n\\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\\n\\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\n    do at the present time.\\n\\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\\n\\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\\n    you\\'re dying.

This is\\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\\n    team\\'s medical/forensic report.\\n\\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\\n\\n\\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\\n\\n    You can\\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\\n    because it can\\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\\n\\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\\n    specialized for travel between Earth\\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\\n    spacecraft.\\n\\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\\n\\n\\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\\n\\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\\n\\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\\'t\\n    know the address) to study the Face.\\n\\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\\n    question in a few years.

It sums up a great\\n   deal of atheistic thought (IMO) in one simple sentence.\\nb) Atheism isn\\'t an \"other religion\".\\n', u'\\n\\n This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the \\n belief that you can\\'t deny anything that you can\\'t prove doesn\\'t exist.\\n This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are\\n conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have\\n to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe\\n in objects or beings that haven\\'t been proved not to exist so why stop at\\n God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan\\n except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond\\n hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can\\'t see them)  The \\n reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians\\n have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.\\n\\n\\n How did they shoot themselves in the foot?\\n\\n\\n  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn\\'t say that he stood for a \\n  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and\\n  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least\\n  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this\\n  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because\\n  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the\\n  russians that helped Stalin that weren\\'t atheists - don\\'t they contradict\\n  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant\\n  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists\\n  can\\'t value life as much as theists (which you didn\\'t support).  \\n\\n\\n Ah, and here\\'s another point you didn\\'t get out of the FAQ.  An atheist\\n doesn\\'t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\\'t exist, he/she may\\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\\'s the example:\\n \\n Strong atheism - \"I believe god does not exist\"   a positive belief\\n\\n Weak atheism   - \"I don\\'t believe in a god\"       a negative belief\\n \\n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\\'s look at it this way (in sets)\\n \\n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:\\n \\n christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god\\n \\n atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)\\n \\n atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set\\n \\n agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E\\', ....) \\n\\n\\n\\n Nietzsche once said that a man would rather will nonexistence than not\\n  will at all but the darwinist way to put this is that humanity always \\n  prefers no or yes to a maybe because indecision is not a useful survival\\n  trait, evolution has drilled it in us to take positions, even false ones.\\n\\n', u'\\n: }Xenophobia, both *de facto* and *de jure* as implemented\\n: }in legal systems, is widespread, while the Bible,\\n: }although not 100% egalitarian, specifically preaches\\n: }kindness to the stranger, and emphasizes in the Book\\n: }of Ruth, that a foreigner can join the nation and\\n: }give rise to one of the great heroes of the nation.\\n: \\n: Clearly better than the alternative, but as an American what strikes\\n: me as strange about this story is that it should have even been\\n: considered an issue.\\n\\nJim,\\n\\nThere are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread\\nthat are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\nweight whatsoever.', u'[...lots of stuff about intellectual errors deleted...]\\n\\nThis is cute, but I see no statement telling me why your church is the true \\nchurch.

It uses freon jets for\\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\\n\\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking\\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\\n\\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \\nquantity.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\\n\\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there.\\n\\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers.\\n\\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\", u'\\nI am not aware of any \"Turkish Caliphate\" viewpoint on this. Can you\\nreference?\\n\\nHowever, I found a quote due to Imam Ali, whom the Shias follow:\\n\\n\"Men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever. Never let them give their\\nadvice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. Indeed, allow\\nthem freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one\\'s\\nwealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.\\n  We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own\\ndevices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal\\ndesires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great\\nanxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most\\ncorrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any\\ncharm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to\\nmiscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they\\nwho oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend\\nto refuse men\\'s solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently.\\nLet us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds.\\nAnd preserve us in any case from their good ones.\"\\n\\n(Quote from Mas\\'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam, \\np. 118).\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM)\\nviewpoint though.  For all we know, the prophet\\'s cousin and\\nthe Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali may have said this after a frustrating \\nnight with a woman.\\n\\nSelim Guncer\\n', u\"Hi.  I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database\\nformat used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores\\nthe points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a \\nlittle and it seems that the points are stored in the order\\nthey are drawn.\\n\\nDoes the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the \\npoints are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert,\\nbut if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know \\nwhich direction the polygon should be visible from.\\n\\nIf DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround?\\nThe best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one\\nin the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.

Could it be that they believed an Islamically owned \\nand operated bank couldn\\'t possibly cheat them? \\n\\nSo please don\\'t try to con us into thinking that it will all \\nwork out right next time.', u'I read it refered to as the \"parabolic cross-section\" rule;\\nthe idea was that if you plot the area of the fuselage cross-\\nsection as a function of the point fore-and-aft along the \\nfuselage, a plot that is a **paraboloid** minimizes somethin\\' \\nor \\'nother (to be technical about it).\\n\\n', u\"I can't fiqure this out.

Some\\nof the .tga's are okay, and other's are unrecognizable by any software.\", u\"\\nSorry.   Wrong.    This is how banks got started in the first place.\\nSooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone\\nwho eventually goes broke, and then they will realise that they\\nhavn't been managing risk very well.   Then they will ask themselves\\nwhat it is that they need to quantify risk, and to persuade borrowers\\nnot to take on greater loans than they can carry.    And since they\\ndon't all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the\\nmoney, some of them will specialise in that.\\n\\nThen they'll reinvent interest, but like good Muslims, they'll call\\nit something else.\\n\\n\\nRiiiight.

If I forgot or botched your\\nfavorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there\\'s an acronym *not*\\non this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure\\nit out, I\\'ll add it to the list.\\n\\nNote that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*\\nacronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated\\nevery acronym I ever saw, I\\'d soon run out of disk space!  :-)\\n\\nThe list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All\\ncomments regarding it are welcome; I\\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.\\n\\nNote that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\\'re on your\\nown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of\\nacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that\\nare essentially always explained as they\\'re introduced are omitted.\\nFurther, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of\\nthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they\\'re simply\\ndifferent ways of referring to the same thing.\\n\\nThanks to everybody who\\'s sent suggestions since the first version of\\nthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),\\nwho is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in\\ncharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),\\nwho is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and\\nterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).\\n\\nSpecial thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA\\nReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and\\nAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly\\nmammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.\\n\\nSpecial Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program\\nwritten by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the\\nacronym list in an entertaining fashion.

I doubt it would do anything. :)', u\"\\nOpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable\\ninterface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It\\nis not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly\\nfrom machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high\\nperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL\\nmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no\\nguarantee that your performance would be comparable.\\n\\n\\nIf your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a\\nvalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI\\nsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\\nshot.\\n\\n\\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\\n1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates\\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI\\n('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power\\nSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\\n18 months to 2 years.\\n\\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\\ndon't, we become uncompetitive.\\n\\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but\\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\\nfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\\n\\n\\nIf that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or\\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\\ncustomer base.\\n\\n\\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\\ncommitments.\\n\\n\\nFive years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor\\ntechnologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at\\nleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature\\nof the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is\\nreally 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability\\nof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.\\n\\nThere are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live\\nwith, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,\\nwe know it.\\n\\nJosh   |:-)\\n\\n-- \\n\", u'\\nIf you are really interested in these orbits and how they are obtained\\nyou should try and find the following paper:\\n\\n     Hiroshi Yamakawa, Jun\\'ichiro Kawaguchi, Nobuaki Ishii, \\n     and Hiroki Matsuo, \"A Numerical Study of Gravitational Capture\\n     Orbit in the Earth-Moon System,\" AAS-92-186, AAS/AIAA Spaceflight\\n     Mechanics Meeting, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 1992.\\n\\nThe references included in this paper are quite interesting also and \\ninclude several that are specific to the HITEN mission itself. ', u'Dear Rob,\\n\\n\\nSometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that\\nway at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I\\'ll\\ntry to get better.\\n\\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\\n\\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \\nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \\nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\\nhis set of excuses.  \\n\\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\\n\\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \\nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn\\'t see it.   Here\\'s is how I see\\nthe dialog:\\n\\n\\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \\n\\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\\n     the oncoming truck.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. I won\\'t because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\\n\\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\\n\\n\\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \\n\\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\\n\\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\\nBrian hasn\\'t gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance.

He assumed that\\n##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by-\\n##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\\n##it)?  \\n##\\n\\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\\nscience.

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.', '', u'I need as much information about Cosmos 2238 and its rocket fragment (1993-\\n018B) as possible.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\\nSagdeev.', u'Is the film from the \"putt-putt\" test vehicle which used conventional\\nexplosives as a proof-of-concept test, or another one?\\n', u'\\n  >I recently have become aware that my health insurance includes\\n  >coverage for abortion.

I have recently become aware\\nthat my health insurance includes coverage for illness and injuries\\nsuffered by Christians.  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums\\nmay be used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is divine\\npunishment for their sinful conduct.  In addition these folks are able to\\navail themselves of such alternative therapies as Lourdes, Fatima,\\nMorris Cerullo, Benny Hinn, etc.  In any case as \"Jesus Saves\\' I feel\\nthat there is no reason for them to be covering their bets at my\\nexpense.  I would like to request that I be exempted from Christian\\ncoverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.', u\"\\nFor better worse, the source on this on is Michael Barnsley. His article\\nin The Science of Fractal Images (Peitgen et al) is a fair-to-middling\\nintro. Barnsley's book Fractals Everywhere is a more thorough treatment.\\nThe book covers Iterated Function Systems in general, and their application\\nto image compression is clear from the text.\", u'\\nActually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused\\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\\'s viewpoint:\\n\\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \\n\\n\\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\\n\\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\\n\\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\\nof the Bible,) God\\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list\\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\\nperson\\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be\\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\\'s\\n\"objective\" morality for us. \\n\\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commits murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who is\\n\\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\\nseeking God\\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\\'s\\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\\nwas/is (and that\\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\\nmorality.\" ', u'WHATS THIS  680x1024 256 color mode?

The\\nprogram was described by these men as \"ineffective . . . not one person was\\nhealed.\"  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent\\nfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were\\ndriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed \"reparative therapy.\"\\n\\nThe previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June\\n30, 1992 called \"The Ex-Ex-Gay\" by Robert Pela.\\n\\nSome personal thoughts:\\n\\nIt is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major\\nportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among\\nits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even\\nlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and\\nsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.\\nToday\\'s scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is\\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is \"physically\" forced\\nto stay in this \"reparative therapy\" but sheer social pressure is enough for\\nmany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.\\n\\nAs an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution\\nagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by\\nthe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,\\nnot by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven\\';t\\na clue what is in their heart.\\n\\nFor those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them\\nplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians\\nAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of\\npeople comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends\\nwho have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to\\na parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some \"first-hand\" real life and\\nloving understanding.  God\\'s love and understanding for Gay people is no\\nless abundant.', u\"\\n\\nThat's right.  Humans have gone somewhat beyond this though.  Perhaps\\nour goal is one of self-actualization.\\n\\n\\nNow you are letting an omniscient being give information to me.  This\\nwas not part of the original premise.\\n\\n\\nWhich type of morality are you talking about?  In a natural sense, it\\nis not at all immoral to harm another species (as long as it doesn't\\nadversely affect your own, I guess).\", u'\\nAny prize like this is going to need to be worded carefully enough that\\nyou cannot get it without demonstrating sustained and reliable capability,\\nrather than a lucky one-shot.  It can be done.', u\"Hi,\\n\\nI'm hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science\\nproject group. We are doing computer science honours, and our project\\nis to do a 'graphical simulator for a finite state automata'.\\n\\nBasically, the program must draw a diagram of a FSA from a textual grammar,\\nshowing circles for states, and labeled arc's in-between.\\n\\nThe problem is working out the best way to layout the states, and draw the\\narc's in-between so that as few arc's as possible cross each other.\\n\\nIf anyone has any suggestions/algorithms/bug-free ready to compile C code :) \\nthat might help us, it would be much appreciated.\\n\\nThanks in advance,\", u'\\n\\n\\nBut of course YOUR version of YOUR position has been included in the\\nCharley Challenges, so your claim above is a flat-out lie.  Further,\\nonly last week you claimed that you \"might not\" answer the Challenges\\nbecause you were turned off by \"included text\".  So which is it, do\\nyou want your context included in my articles or not?  Come to think\\nof it, this contradiction has the makings of a new entry in the next\\nChallenges post.\\n\\nBy the way, I\\'ve kept every bloody thing that you\\'ve written related\\nto this thread, and will be only too pleased to re-post any of it to\\nback my position.  You seem to have forgotten that you leave an\\nelectronic paper trail on the net.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, now, let\\'s not change the subject.

They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure.\\nThey may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the \\nBoobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of \\nSatanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is \\nknown.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the \\nMasons have already fired back in their own magazines against the \\nBoobtist Witch-hunt.\\n  Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with \\ntheir war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on \\ntheir Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and \\nmore Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a \\nhandful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop \\n'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.\\n  So as far as I am concerned, the louder, ruder, and more outrageous \\nan Anti-Masonic Crusade these old goats mount, the better.\\n\\nPop some pocorn and get a center row seat.

(Just a note: I really don\\'t know your views on\\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\\nhave their faces uncovered.\\n\\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \\n                                                                         \\n\\n\\t(Evidence deleted)\\n\\nI\\'m not going to accept your evidence for this.

Too bad I can't go.\", u'There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today\\'s\\nLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\\nits competitiveness agenda.\\n\\n......', u'...\\n\\n\\tBefore or after his kids were shot?\\n\\n\\n\\tThen why make the comment?\\n\\n\\n\\tAs did the Jews against the Nazis in WW II:  do what I say or die.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tALl humans, I hope.\\n\\n\\n\\tOr perhaps they have:  kill first, blame the dead ones,\\n\\tdestroy all the evidence.\\n', u\"\\nWow!

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs!

I doubt you could even come up with\\nanything that could be said to be universally \"good\" or \"bad\".\\n\\nAnd when I referred to \"the truth\" I was using the term\\nhypothetically, realizing full well that there may not even be such a\\nthing.\\n\\n\\nTrue enough.  But they cannot be said to be anything more than\\npersonal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any\\nsense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any\\nsocially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \"higher authority\"\\n(aka, absolute moral truth).\\n\\n\\nAn objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth?\\nInteresting notion.   :-)\\n\\nCertainly one can have as one\\'s morals a belief that compromise is\\ngood.

If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either\\nconfused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the\\nchain inside SGI was misleading them.\\n\\n\\nThere were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came\\nout at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The\\nchassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was\\na pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and\\nage.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the\\nhardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our\\nminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost\\nfrom the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in\\nthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over\\nits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.\\n\\n\\nPlease, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support\\nor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks\\nto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there\\nwill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,\\nbut that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you\\nare referring to).\\n\\nYes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,\\nbut that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result\\nin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into\\nsystems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*\\nyou to buy at end of quarter, after all...)\\n\\n\\nThey don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly\\nthey get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions\\nmay well influence the end product, but that also is life in the\\nindustry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we\\nwon't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we\\ndon't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).\\n\\n\\nBut surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year\\nperiod to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year\\nperiod?

O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free\\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\\nestablished in the self.\\n  \\n                                PURPORT\\n\\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\\nbeginning of transcendental life.\\n\\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\\n\\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\\nBooks of A.C.

I\\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\n\\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\\n\\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\nthe space station.\\n\\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\navailable funds.\\n\\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\nthe NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology\\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\\n\\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\nconsider.\\n\\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\n\\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\\nachieving that goal.\\n\\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"', u'I am looking for some information about 3D animation stations that\\nare currently on the market.

By biblical scholar I mean\\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\\n\\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \\nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \\nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\\n\\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\\nhere.  What\\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\\nbelief is based on faith.  That\\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\\nfaith off as fact.\\n\\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\\'t a perfect canon be perfect? \\nShouldn\\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \\nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \\nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \\nan evolutionary ancestry).\\n\\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \\nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \\nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \\n\\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \\nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\\nresurrected, 4) Jesus\\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \\ncontain the first four.  \\n\\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\\n\\nIts faith, Bill.  You don\\'t have any more or better truths than anyone else. \\nWhatever works for you.

S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \"Love is the unfamiliar Name\\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\"\\n\\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\\n\\n\\nblechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one\\'s own notion of \"sin\" on\\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\\n\\n\\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\\nprohibitions.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\\n\\n\\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\\n\\t    in the Inquisition.\\n\\n\\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\\n\\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\\n\\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\\n\\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\\n\\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\\n\\n\\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\\n\\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\\n\\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\\n\\n\\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\\n\\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\\'s B,\\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\\nof charges brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, as if one\\'s theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\\nJesus\\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\\n\\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\n\\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\\nthey *aren\\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions.  The Great\\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"\\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\\n\\n\\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\nIt does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\\n\\n\\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\\n\\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\\n\\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\\'ll\\n\\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\\n\\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\\n\\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\\n\\n\\nI think you are begging the question.

While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \\nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\\nslots.\\n\\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\\nsupporting Tonga\\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \\n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \\nthe Pacific Rim. \\n\\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \\nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \\nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \\nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\n\\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \\nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\\n\\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \\nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \\nSiberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\\n\\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \\napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \\nspecifications, they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \\nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \\nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\\nnow.\\n\\nTidbits:\\n\\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\n\\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\\nwithin 9 months.\\n\\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\\n\\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\\npartly because we aren\\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\'t worry \\nbecause we\\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\nreally goes on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability as much.\\n\\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\\n\\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \\nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\\n\\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \\ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\nhardware.\\n', u\"\\nThis is an interesting notion -- and one I'm scared of.

Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\\nan arbitrary matter.

In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n', u'\\nIf the first rule of humor is never having to say you\\'re sorry then the \\nsecond rule must be never having to explain yourself.

They did not know, or were not\\nsure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the \\ncompound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were\\nsupposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.\\n\\nI spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR\\n(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to\\n  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive\\n  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS \\n  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)\\n\\nSince it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin\\nof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \"no good\"\\nbecause it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not \\nthe authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time \\nbefore I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, \\nProfessor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the \\nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People\\'s magazine (Spring \\n1993 edition):\\n\\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \\n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \\n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\\n  those who don\\'t fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn\\'t draw\\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \\n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\\n  and who isn\\'t by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\\n  that the central pillar of Christ\\'s \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\\n\\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \\n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\\n\\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \\n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don\\'t like.\\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons\\' rights along with those of\\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\\n\\n\\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\\nto This People\\'s magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\\narms.  \\n\\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \\nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \\nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \\nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \\nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \\nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \\nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \\nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \\nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \\nvoice is louder.  That\\'s really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand\\non in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter \\nthe LDS Church\\' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths \\nand non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to \\ndisprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. \\nLet us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion \\nand conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.  \\n', u'\\nThe Apollo fire was harsh, A Saturn V explosion would have been\\nhurtful but The Soviets winning would have been crushing.

I am _not_ asking you to take\\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\\n_yourself_.\\n\\n\\nIf slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some\\nMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual\\npurposes is necessarily opposed too.\\n\\n\\nI understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_\\nwho are not getting through to _you_.\\n\\nSome of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.\\n\\nRegarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,\\nshowing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been\\ncompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a\\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted from\\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.', u'On sunsite.unc.edu in pub/multimedia/utilities/unix find \\n mpeg_play-2.0.tar.Z.\\n\\nI find for mono it works best as mpeg_play -dither threshold \\n   though you can use            mpeg_play -dither mono\\n\\nFace it, this is not be the best viewing situation.\\n\\nAlso someone has made a patch for mpeg_play that gives two more mono\\nmodes  (mono2 and halftone).\\n\\nThey are by jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au (Jan Newmarch).\\nAnd the patch can be found on csc.canberra.edu.au (137.92.1.1) under\\n/pub/motif/mpeg2.0.mono.patch.\\n', u'I am doing a political science paper on the funding of NASA and pork-barrel \\npolitics.

I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.\\n\\n\\nWell, I\\'m no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They\\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before \"the night of the\\nlong knives\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\\nescapes me at the moment) called \"Homosexuals in History\" asserts that Roehm\\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm\\'s SA circle.\\n\\n\\nWell, you\\'re the one who is in Germany. If you don\\'t believe the history books,\\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \"knight of the\\nlong knives\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\\'s\\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\\'ve \\nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \\n\\n\\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \\nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \\nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don\\'t you think they \\nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \\nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \\n\\n\\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\\n\\n\\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\\n\\nI don\\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\\'s friends\\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \\nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \\nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \\nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \\nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\\'t have the time. Nothing is\\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources.

I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \\ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \\nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\\n\\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \\n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\\nIllinois. Mr Nelson\\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \\nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \\nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\\'t think the details\\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\\nthey aren\\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\\n\\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \\nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\\n                  ______\\n3 G         /|   /      |\\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \\n          /  | /        |\\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\\n       /                |          the graph wasn\\'t up for very long.\\n1 G   /                 |\\n                        |\\n                        |\\n0 G                     |\\n\\n             ^          ^\\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\\n\\n\\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \\nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \\naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\\nout entirely.\\n\\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \\nthat desired.\\n\\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\\n\\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\\n    all at once?\\n\\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\\n\\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\\n\\nA:  Can\\'t tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good \\n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \\n\\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\\n\\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \\nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\\'s reentry profile about \\n60 degrees south latitude.\\n\\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\\'t know about that\\naspect of the flight profile.\\n', u'What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and\\nthe algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which\\nrequires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns\\nwhether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn\\nmethod.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several\\ncomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the\\ntransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the\\nscreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My\\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this\\nmethod before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.\\n\\nLibertarian, atheist, semi-anarchal Techno-Rat.', u'\\nThanks for typing that in, Steven.

To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\\n\\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\\n\\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\\nindex is near the optimal level.\\n\\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\\n\\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10.

Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\\ndata from this test are being conducted.

Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\\n\\t     however.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \\n \\t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \\n\\t     It\\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\\n\\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \\n    \\t     Unless you\\'ve given permission for that, it\\'s illegal.  OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\\n\\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".

In fact, it is the combination of the two\\nstatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to\\ncharacterize that as \"ignoring\" the instruction to spread the\\nword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\"\\n\\nOf course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \"instruction\\nto spread the word.\"\\n\\nAll these quotes btw are from:\\n\\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>\\n\\n\\nAnd I claim it correctly, because my question went:\\n\\n\"Do you, too, measure\\nthe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not\\na whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\"\\n\\nand the closest Dean came to an answer was:\\n\\n\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You\\'re just so stupid, pretentious, dull,\\nand generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that\\nthe sport is all there is.\"\\n\\nOf course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts\\nin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,\\nyet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:\\n\\n\"So I now restore the answer to your question\\nthat you deleted.  If you\\'re still unable to figure it out, ask\\na nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really\\ndoesn\\'t take much sophistication to understand.\"\\n\\nOn top of which, I doubt that the \"answer\" is at all representative\\nof Dean\\'s true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus\\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean\\'s \\nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\\nOne wonders whether Dean\\'s mind is so warped as to find sport in all\\nthis.\\n\\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthe \"sins\" of other individuals.\"\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one\\'s sins.\\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\\n\\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\\n\\nDean again:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself\\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\\n\\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\\n\\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \\nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\\n\\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\\nthe basis of one insult after another.', u\"Sketch:  Rotate so cylinder axis is || Z axis.\\n\\nIntersect X/Y projection of line with projected cylinder (similar to,\\nbut easier than, sphere intersection).  Result: no intersection, one\\nintersection, or two intersections, parameterized along line by t0 and\\nt1.  Now look at Z, and compute intersections of line with top and\\nbottom planes of cylinder.  This gives t0' and t1'.  The interval of\\nintersection is then the bit of the line from [t0,t1] INTERSECT [t0',t1'].\\n\\nDetails left as an exercise for the reader.\\n\\n=S\", u'I recently read an article in a local paper written by an Islamic\\n  person who was upset with the way Islam has been portrayed by western media.\\n  When a terrorist action takes place in the middle east, it is always played\\n  up as an Islamic Terrorist.  However, when the a Serbian terrorist attacks\\n  the Croations, its not a Christian terrorist, its just a terrorist.\\n\\tI have often tried to explain this to some close friends who believe\\n  the press, that Islam is somehow tied to violence.  Often times you hear\\n  things like \"They just don\\'t value human life like we do...\" and so on.\\n  I was wondering if anyone out there had any suggestions for how we can\\n  change this image, or how I can help my friends to see that this is just \\n  hype.

I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \\navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \\nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\\nseems to argue over what.\\n\\n\\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\\'m not\\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \\nthink the masses can\\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \\nincapable; they just don\\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \\nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \\nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \\ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \\nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \\nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \\nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \\n\\n\\nNo.  In fact, I don\\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \\nIsn\\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \\ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \\npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \\nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\\'t\\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\\'s a tough one for\\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \\nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \\nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \\nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \\nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \\nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \\nconvoluted here; I hope I\\'ve made sense.  \\n\\n\\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \\nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \\nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \\nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \\nnaturalists\\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \\nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuch obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn\\'t it?

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993.

Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".

It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend\\nupon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base\\nwould have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think\\nthat the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value\\nof going to Mars (at least in the short run).

First, in February, the Russians deployed a\\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\\ndeployed by the inflatable \\'frame\\'.\\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\\'s\\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\\'s\\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \\'unit\\' cost\\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\\n  \\nBut back to Brian\\'s questions:\\n  \\n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\\'t piggy back upon\\nsomeone else\\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\\nlaunch.  That\\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\\'t think the\\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\\nand no, I don\\'t really like the idea of this additional light\\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\\nidiot?)\\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\\'s in a low\\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\\'s the time\\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\\'t heard of any serious funding\\nfor this, but I\\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\\n  \\n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\\nmy guest.

What, you may ask, does gas guns\\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\n\\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\n\\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\nof atmospheres.\\n\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\n\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\n\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\nto follow the projectiles.\\n\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\n\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\n\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\nsized payloads into space.

Without delving into a deep discussion of\\n: >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\\n: >>perfect and without flaw. \\n: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\\n\\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\\nof this statement, shouldn\\'t we?\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\\n: scientific perspective, just different.\\n\\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \\ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\\n \\n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\\n: but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\\n\\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\\n\\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\\nmore important than we\\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \\n \\n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\\n\\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \\n\\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\\n\\nI\\'d replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \\ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\\nevolve.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry I can\\'t give any references, this is based on the course\\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \\n\\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \\n\\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \\n\\nI can understand Scott\\'s reaction:\\n\\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\\n: > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what \\n: > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME\\n: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  \\n: \\n: In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.\\n: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you\\n: cannot *know* that.\\n\\nI hope you don\\'t forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests \\neverything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against\\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \\nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \\nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\\nand not to present one\\'s own conclusions prior to this. \\n\\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\\n\\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \\n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \\n: >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\\n: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\\n: >>diseases/disorders.\\n\\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \\nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn\\'t make it \\nto the present. \\n\\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven\\'t seen much evidence for either\\nclaim.\\n \\n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\\n: answering John\\'s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God\\'s fault? (the original\\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\\n\\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god\\'s fault.  But your explanation does\\nnot work, it fails miserably.\\n \\n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don\\'t know that\\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\\n: \\n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\\n: that affect mankind?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\\n\\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\\n: Actually what you\\'ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the\\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\\n: universe.\\n\\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\\n\\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\\n  \\n: Oh, I admit it\\'s not perfect (yet).

Biology and Genetics are\\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don\\'t explain\\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\\n\\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\\nthese books.\\n\\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\\n \\n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\\n: of biology and genetics, although I\\'m sure I\\'d find it a\\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\\n: environment.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but they do.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.

Or, to put it more technically, the extra \"volume\" they add\\n to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible.\\n \\n Jupiter is 2E27 kg, while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23.\\n \\n Also, as I said, the few references that I\\'ve looked at do not\\n mention outgassing or breakup as important processes.  The important\\n thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet \"reverse slingshot\" that leads to a\\n weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet (at least a temporary one).', u'Tony-\\n\\nI read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other\\ntypical\"Christian\" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\\'s great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\\nin the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually\\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I\\'ve\\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\\n\\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\\noppressive legisation against gays.\\n\\nPerhaps you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God\\'s will be done as they massacred thousands\\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\\n\\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. This is\\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\\nwill \\'naturally\\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\'s expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\\nsomething very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedrooms.  It\\'s funny that most straight people have successfully\\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminals.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\'s pastors arrested for self-\\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\\nColorado has created an organization who\\'s posters are appearing all over\\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\\nembracing.\\n\\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntowards those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\\nexcluding people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin\\'s books and find them quite helpful,\\nespecially concerning \\'cults.\\' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\\nitself.  Why don\\'t we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\\nto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\\n\\nWhatever', u'\\n\\n\\n        Yep...

These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\\n: These days is just ain\\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \\n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\\'s sex &c (but that\\'s \\n: another arguement...) so it\\'s more of a \"lifestyle\" decision.  Again by\\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \\n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\\n\\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\\nhomosexuals don\\'t procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\\n\\n: \\n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\\n: |> choice that should be protected by law.

The fact\\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\\nand my faith would be vanity.\\n\\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\\nsays why in John 15:18-25.   That\\'s no mystery either.  \"The\\nworld hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation\\nof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\\nneed a Saviour.', u\"\\nJehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Christians are required to observe\\nthe Sabbath, whether it is on Saturday or Sunday.

Are you truly the master of yourself?\\n\\nI have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times.\\nThat I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake\\nunwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect\\nof my being.  There are times I know I shouldn\\'t say something, but\\nthen say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson.\\nI, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me\\nthis help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let\\nJesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than\\nI myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation\\nbetter than the creation?

It seems from your\\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\".\\nI apologize.\\n\\n\\nI have often wondered about this.  I\\'ve always thought that the first bomb\\nshould have been dropped on Japan\\'s island fortress of Truk.  A good,\\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could\\'ve been held back\\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\\n\\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US\\'s\\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \\ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\\nback-water country, we probably wouldn\\'t intervene.  Not that we don\\'t\\ncare, but we can\\'t be the world\\'s policman.  Or if a coup had occured\\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn\\'t have acted\\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West\\'s oil \\ninterests, caused us to take action.\\n\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI\\'m not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\\n\\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\\nwould lead their nation to.\\n\\n\\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\\nbut that\\'s The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nProbably because we\\'re not the saviors of the world.  We can\\'t police each\\nand every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor\\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\\nsome other places.\\n\\nTell me how we could stop them and I\\'ll support it.

You can criticize\\nthe system, but let\\'s not have unfounded allegations of racial \\nprejudice thrown around.\\n\\n\\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\\n\\n\\nGermans, perhaps.  \"Peers\" doesn\\'t mean \"those who do the same thing\",\\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means \"having people from\\nthe same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better\\nposition to understand the defendent\\'s motivation(s).\\n\\n\\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\\n\\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\\n\\nBTW, I never used the word \"conspiracy\".  I don\\'t accept (without *far*\\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\\n\\n\\nHardly.  I didn\\'t say that it\\'s a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don\\'t live in a perfect world and\\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn\\'t say\\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\\n\\n\\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\\nand suffering.  I\\'m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\\'s say) we now know.  That doesn\\'t\\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\\'t see it as\\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\\n\\nBut don\\'t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\\ndon\\'t!  I just don\\'t condemn those who had to make a difficult\\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\\n\\n\\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\\n\\n\\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.

I don\\'t believe that you can make the\\nsame claim.\\n\\n\\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \\n\"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\\nwasn\\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \\nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \\n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \\nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \\nWhat hogwash.  If \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilians died, \\nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \\nthe Allied bombing.\\n\\nRegards,', u'\\nI certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works\\nvery well.

I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological\\npatterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating\\nthat you weren\\'t referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some\\natheists who you feel don\\'t fit your patterns, to show that you indeed\\nwere not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed\\nto do so.  Please do so now.\\n\\nQuestion: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your\\nstereotype?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n\\n\\n2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that \"senses and\\nreason are all we have to go by\", and when pressed, you have implied\\nthat we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly\\nasked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both\\nexperience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses\\nand reason.  You failed to do so.

You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by\\na.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify\\none such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do\\nso now.\\n\\nQuestion: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and\\nfantastical?  If so, please repeat them.\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n\\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n\\n\\n4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as\\na result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the\\n\"axioms\" of reason that one couldn\\'t help but become atheist.  I asked\\nyou to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement\\nthat the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that\\nI have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer\\nthe question.  Please do so now.\\n\\nQuestion: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become\\natheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that\\neffect?  If you don\\'t retract that claim, do you retract the\\nsubsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably\\nresult in atheism?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n[First quote]\\n[Second quote]\\n\\n\\n5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these\\nChallenges because they contained too much in the way of \"included\\ntext\" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn\\'t\\nrespond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify\\nthis seeming contradiction.\\n\\nQuestion:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context\\nfrom your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to\\navoid \"included text\"?\\n\\nHere is the context for the question:\\n\\n\\n\\nthen later...\\n\\n\\n\\nAs usual, your responses are awaited with anticipation.\\n\\n--Dave Wood\\n\\n\\np.s., For the record, below is a compilation of Charley\\'s responses to\\nthese challenges to date.\\n\\n3/18/93\\n\\n3/31/93 (#1)\\n\\n3/31/93 (#2)', u'\\nWell, if they were Satanists, or followers of an obscure religion,\\nthen I would be sure that Christians would in unison condemn and \\nmake this to a show case.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\\n\\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\\nspiritual explanations. \\n\\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn\\'t: it is self-\\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \\n\\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\\n\\n There is no need\\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\n: determnined.\\n\\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\\nwill or not? \\n\\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\n: acquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident.\\n\\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \\nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\\nsurvive, those which don\\'t don\\'t make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\\n\\n: For an atheist, no\\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\n: an event can have value. \\n\\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \\n\\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\\nfor starters.\\n\\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\n: establish your values.\\n\\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\\nseverely flawed.\\n\\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one\\'s\\nown people.\\n\\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\\nof other nations. \\n\\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\\n\\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n: - that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\n\\nIt looks like you haven\\'t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \\nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\\nof some physical event), and other\\'s happiness, too, if the observer\\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\\nmeaning. \\n\\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \\npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\\ndo not exist. \\n\\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others\\'\\nexistence.\\n\\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \\n\\n: That you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\n: or God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\n\\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\\n\\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\\ncease to be subjective. \\n\\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \\ninherently subjective. \\n\\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\\nwe don\\'t, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\\'s\\nown and then to get mad at this. \\n\\nGod must be schizophrenic.\\n\\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\n: etc. and cannot participate.

It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the\\nQuran\\'s message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly\\nanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings\\nit can guide you.

Let\\'s try to discuss these\\ninterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can\\nignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try\\nto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but\\nprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.', u'\\n\\n\\tThe newspaper itself is almost certainly copyrighted in its\\nentirety.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\\nformalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works, and refreshingly direct\\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\\n\\nJAMES A.

In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\\nGod\\'s purposes.\\n\\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \\nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \\nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \\n\\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \\npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\\n\\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \\nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \\nJesus\\' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \\nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \\npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \\nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \\naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \\nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \\nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \\nGod\\'s Law.\\n\\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \\nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \\non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \\nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \\nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\\n\\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \\nLaw in this way:\\n\\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \\nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \\nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \\njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \\nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \\nin Christ Jesus.\\n\\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \\nserved it\\'s purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \\nas Christ said he would do.\\n\\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \\nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\\nre-expressed in Christianity. \\n\\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it\\'s purpose and \\nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \\nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \\nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \\nrepresenting Christ\\'s death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\\nThe Lord\\'s supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\\nActs 20:7)\\n\\nOK, That\\'s one Christian\\'s explanation.  I don\\'t claim to have all\\nthese issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome\\nother Christians to offer other alternatives.\\n\\nPlease excuse the long posting.  Thanks for your interest if you have read \\nthis far...', '', u'\\nI have heard that the sabbath was originally determined by the phases of\\nthe moon, and had elements of moon worship.  Early stuff, Egyptian in nature.\\n', u'Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For\\nexample, Why couldn\\'t Magellan just be told to go into a \"safe\"\\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \\n\\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\\n\"turned off\" rather than just \"safed\".  Was it political (i.e.\\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\\'s hair....  \\n\\nI\\'ve heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\"\\nspacecraft causes \"radio noise.\"  I find that hard to believe\\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode.\\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\\nprepared if necessary.  \\n\\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\\ngreat, if not, so it\\'s lost and no big deal.\\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\\ndata even if they\\'re not willing to contact the spacecraft.\\n\\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \\n\\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\\netc) should consider designing in a \"pause\" mode in case their\\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\\n\"drift\" phase.\\n\\nSo any holes in all this?\\n', u'\\nThe Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version\\nwas used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used\\ntoday.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)\\norbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  Since this is\\nthe version that launched Mir and the Salyuts (and the add-on modules for Mir),\\nas long as Centaur is smaller than Mir (which I believe it is), it should fit\\nunder the shroud.\\n\\nI vaguely recall that the Russians are developing a LH2/LOX upper stage for the\\nProton.', u'\\nThe CU people have been, and continue to be big ozone scientists. So \\nthis is consistent. It is also consistent with the new \"Comercial \\napplications\" that NASA and Clinton are pushing so hard. \\n\\nDid anyone catch the rocket that was launched with a movie advert \\nall over it? I think the rocket people got alot of $$ for painting \\nup the sides with the movie stuff. What about the Coke/Pepsi thing \\na few years back? NASA has been trying to find ways to get other \\npeople into the space funding business for some time. Frankly, I\\'ve \\nthought about trying it too. When the funding gets tight, only the \\ninnovative get funded. One of the things NASA is big on is co-funding. \\nIf a PI can show co-funding for any proposal, that proposal has a SIGNIFICANTLY\\nhigher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no \\nco-funding.

There have been some good points made in this group that is not \\nimpossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.\\n\\n->\\tSome reasons why he wouldn\\'t be a liar are as follows.  Who would \\n->die for a lie?  Wouldn\\'t people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People \\n->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing \\n->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did \\n->heal people.  \\n\\n\\nLogic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn\\'t\\nmean that it isn\\'t true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.\\nHe has followers that don\\'t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.\\nBy not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what \\nhe believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\\nconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \\nthat faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren\\'t that compeling,\\nso the stories got bigger to appeal better.\\n\\n->\\tNiether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn \\n->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example \\n->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see \\n->this right away.\\n->\\tTherefore since he wasn\\'t a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the \\n->real thing.  \\n\\n\\nOr might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who\\nuse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, because\\nin the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are \\npossible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\\nall other possible alternatives.\\n\\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \\nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \\nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn\\'t one of\\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\\n\\n->\\tSome other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in \\n->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal \\n->and Crucifixion.  I don\\'t have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I \\n->write I will use it.\\n\\nJC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn\\'t be any great shakes to make\\nsure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there\\nwere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet \\nfullfilled them anyway.\\n\\n->\\tI don\\'t think most people understand what a Christian is.  It \\n->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it \\n->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God\\'s \\n->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \\n->same.  Hey we can\\'t do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives \\n->over to him.  That\\'s tuff and most people don\\'t want to do it, to be a \\n->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But \\n->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes \\n->time.  We don\\'t rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.  \\n->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in \\n->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this \\n->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be \\n->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for \\n->ourselves.  \\n\\nHere I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says \\nseriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for \\nXians that don\\'t.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.  The picking and choosing\\nthat I see a lot of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nJim\\t  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJames L.

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\\nwill look better.\\n\\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n\\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet\\'s widow, Aisha, who was recognized\\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\\n\\n\\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \\n\\n\\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\\n\\n\\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\\n\\n\\nThe Prophet\\'s first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\\nProphet\\'s journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\\n\\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.', u'Thanks for the Update.', u'\\tNor, to point out the obvious, are the deluded, siege-mentality\\nfollowers of a religious nut-case who thought he was Jesus Christ or possibly\\nThe Big Guy.\\n\\tPersonally, much as I regard the BATF and FBI as ConDupes, I\\'ll take\\ntheir word over a bunch of silly pinks who were stoopid enough to lock\\nthemselves up with a goofball like \"David Koresh\" in a makeshift arsenal.\\n\\t************************************************************\\n\\t*  \\tThe_Doge of South St. Louis\\t\\t\\t   *\\n\\t*\\t\\tDobbs-Approved Media Conspirator(tm)\\t   *\\n\\t*\\t\"One Step Beyond\"  -- Sundays, 3 to 5 pm\\t   *\\n\\t*\\t\\t88.1 FM\\t\\tSt. Louis Community Radio  *\\n\\t*  \"You\\'ll pay to know what you *really* think!\"           *\\n\\t*\\t\\t\\t-- J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs\"\\t\\t   *\\n\\t************************************************************\\n', u'I bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago.  it seems to be a\\ngreat card especially with my multimedia presentations.

I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and\\nI suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily\\nagree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.\\n\\n *\\n\\nFor a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book\\nclaiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.\\n(Mr Holly\\'s father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the\\nMasons.)\\n\\nThe SBC\\'s Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,\\nwhich studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few\\nyears ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded\\nthat it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.\\nHowever, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and\\nlast year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the\\nfeeling that they were saying \"You got the wrong answer last time, try to\\ndo better and get the answer we want.\")\\n\\nAnyway, there\\'s been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but\\nthe dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,\\nbut everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things\\nsuch as: \"This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.\"\\n\\nThe report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the\\nhospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the\\nelderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-\\nknown Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings\\nof Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Examples of\\nthe latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and\\nthat some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible\\nwith Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some\\npeople consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they\\nare not meant seriously), the \"undeniably pagan and/or occultic\" writings of\\nsome Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation\\ncan be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many\\nMasonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole\\naren\\'t really in a place to speak on this last point.)\\n\\n\\nThe report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership\\nshould not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.\\nThis was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,\\nand while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may\\nnot.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of\\nthe believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably\\ninfluenced how the report came out.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThe information above was gleaned from \"The Religious Herald\", a publication\\nof the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and \"Baptists Today\", which\\ndoes not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a\\nbig issue among some Baptists.  8-)\\n\\nBecause I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are\\nrelevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.

It was largely the mainstream Christian\\'s disgust\\n#at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.\\n\\nTrue, but that is exactly the \"problem\": the Mormon extermination order\\nwas issued not just by a Christian, it was ALLOWED under the Constitution\\nof the United States, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents\\nlike this \"order\" from occurring in the first place...  As I indicated in\\nan earlier posting, your \"irrational hatred\" is clearly evidenced by\\nindividuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs\\' Lieutenant;\\nhe would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day\\noccurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,\\nlies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.\\n\\nIn intent and purpose, what really has changed?\\n\\n#The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings\\n#and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don\\'t think most of them\\n#are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and\\n#perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification\\n#which discourages critical thought.\\n\\nTrue, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you\\'re aware.\\n\\n#>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and\\n#>I don\\'t even discuss how Uthan\\'s were suckered into allowing part of their\\n#>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from\\n#>being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I\\n#>may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the\\n#>case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church\\n#>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-\"Peace Keeper\"\\n#>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another \"inspired\" decision from\\n#secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough\\n#for the feds to back off.\\n#\\n#Do you mean that the \"secular authorities\" are some continuous group of\\n#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the\\n#Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for\\n#nuclear testing etc.. was to \"get them thar Mormons\"?  And what about the\\n#majority of Uthan\\'s who aren\\'t Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy\\n ^^^^^^^^\\n(Correction: the majority of Utahn\\'s ARE Mormon (60-70% I believe, up to a\\n 100% in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states.)\\n\\n#conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you\\n#badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe\\nthat Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert\\ntruth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary\\nhas power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be\\na good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and\\nevil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don\\'t you suppose that the\\ndestroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?\\n\\nAs far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples\\nof environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have\\nbrought death, disease, (i.e. the \"downwinders\") and environmental contami-\\nnation.  I am hardly \"paranoid,\" I am just not \"expecting\" too much from a\\nsecular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed\\n(as Gov. Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  As a matter of\\nfact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)\\npersecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that\\n(paraphrasing) \"all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must\\nflee to Zion.\"  Zion (the \"pure in heart\") will be re-established in those\\ndays, and it AIN\\'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it...\\n\\n#>...

Khomeini put a \\nprice on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk\\nas well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that\\nthere was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who\\nare free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an \\nMuhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that\\nMuhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus\\nno muslim is free from error. \\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is\\nwidespread agreement about matters of Islam.

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

A small minority of those who do believe\\nreads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn\\'t care - it believes,\\nbut doesn\\'t know what or how. \\n\\nPeople don\\'t usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle,\\nthey only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say\\nthat they are not \"born in the Spirit\", but this does not disturb them.\\nReligion is not something to think about. \\n\\nI\\'m afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible\\ndream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless - \\na promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to.\\nCoupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our\\nmorality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many\\npeople take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow\\n(and unconsciously hope god wouldn\\'t notice ;-) )\\n\\n: Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a\\n: higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The\\n: typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the\\n: same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the\\n: other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn\\n: somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,\\n: than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it\\n: expresses its own selfishness.\\n\\nIf logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking\\nis of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary\\nassumptions they believe in - I\\'ve yet to see good reasons to believe\\nin gods, or to take a leap of faith at all.

Where do they come \\n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\\n#whatever is societally mandated.\\n\\nIt\\'s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\\n\\n#\\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\\n#>#\\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\\n#>#\\n#>#1)Who is society\\n#\\n#>Depends on the society.\\n#\\n#Doesn\\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.

Only if the secular authorities agree\\nthat there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there\\nany secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past\\ngroup member.\\n\\nA religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties\\nof a group member.

In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular\\nauthorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities.\\nOutside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.

God's laws were originally written for \\n: the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to\\n: all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of\\n: Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made\\n: obsolete by Jesus.\\n\\nJust for reference, here's the earlier quote:\\nMalcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9\\nand Deuteronomy 22:20-25:\\n: These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had\\n: expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a\\n: direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God\\n: is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately\\n: punishable.\\n: Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to\\n: God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in\\n: the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There\\n: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And\\n: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew\\n: and Gentile alike.\\n\\nThese are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the\\nother is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on\\nan issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change\\nwas made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus\\nchange that?\\n\\n: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the\\n: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon\\n: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.\\n\\nSure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning\\nnon-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to\\ndeny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?\\n\\n: I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of\\n: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe\\n: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?\\n\\nI'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible\\nfrom end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this\\nknowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and\\nback it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David\\nKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if\\nthey actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly\\nmade the means look frightening.\\n\\nHowever, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but\\nbelieve every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far\\nmore of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy\\nto manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough\\nto debate with these people.\\n\\n: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's\\n: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.\\n\\nNo, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told\\nme how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will\\nby doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to\\nobey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to\\ntwo millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it\\nwith my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing\\nthe will of God.\\n\\n: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is\\n: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.\\n\\nWell, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about\\neternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from\\nthe god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.\\n\\n: God be with you,\\n\\nNot yours, thanks ;)\\n\\n: Malcolm Lee  :)\\n\\nRob Lanphier\\nlanphi872@snake.cs.uidaho.edu\\nlanph872@uidaho.edu\\n\\nAnd for the curious, here is my earlier post:\", u'\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an\\ninterpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to\\nthe original Arabic.  Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer\\nto use Dr. Maurice Bucaille\\'s translations (in his book, \"The Bible, the\\nQur\\'an and Science\") for in general his translations are more literal.\\n \\nMaurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing\\nas \\n\\n\"...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.\"\\n\\n(Also note that \"the celestial bodies\" in the first translation quoted\\nby you above is the translator\\'s interpolation -- it is not existent in\\nthe original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.) \\n\\n\\nYou\\'re right, what the verses _do_ contain isn\\'t all that remarkable.\\n\\nHowever, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that\\'s how he\\'s a \"Dr.\") thinks it is\\nsignificant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even\\nthough geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so.\\n(And this goes for the rest of the Qur\\'an as well, which has about 750\\nverses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)', u'        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no\\nnotes so I\\'ll try to wing it...  \\n        Here\\'s how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that \\nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\\nthey don\\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\\'s) will be in the plane of the\\ngalaxy.  \\n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\\'s an \\nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \\n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\\'t work, also.  As I\\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \\nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\\nthese characteristics.

In this case, the definition of the word \"create\"\\nis of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.\\n\\n\\n  I should have said \"given the Mormon belief.\"  If you disagree with the\\nMormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally\\nexistent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important\\npoint.\\n\\n\\n  Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by\\nsuch terms.\\n\\n   It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they\\nbelieve.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and\\nLucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or\\norganized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being \"offspring\" of\\nGod has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually \"born again\" of\\nHim.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is\\nhow language works, Robert, and it\\'s why making someone an offender for a\\nword is dangerous.\\n\\n\\n<...>\\n\\n   On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those\\nwho rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.

You did not refer to the Mormon belief\\nthat Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie\\'s belief in same.  We\\nkeep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of\\nMormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)\\n\\n\\n  On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie\\'s words as Mormon\\ncanon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great*\\nimportance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate\\ngeneral Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large\\nnumber of Mormons.', u'\\nDon\\'t listen to this guy, he\\'s just a crank.

As I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\\nreferences though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:\\n\\n\\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\\n\\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\\n\\n\\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\\'s all part of the same verse we\\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \\nthese issues.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n\\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding', u'\\nI assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths?\\n \\n\\nAgain, I\\'d like to see some evidence.\\n \\n\\nOnce again, where\\'s your proof? Suicide is considered a sin by Branch\\nDavidians.  Also, Koresh said over and over again that he was not going to\\ncommit suicide.  Furthermore, all the cult experts said that he was not\\nsuicidal.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.', u'\\nCould be the (folk?) song \"Clementine\".

But these were\\nmiracles of our parent\\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\\nhave told us - \"you\\'ve lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\\n\\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\\'s work - and yes struggle\\n- to build this nation\\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\\n\\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\\nSchriever\\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\\n\\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \\nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\\'ve listened\\nto your stories.  We\\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \\nAnd we\\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\\ninto today\\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\\n\\n     You told us in the 60\\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\\naviation in the 1920\\'s and 30\\'s - build a little and test a little\\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\\nstarted this program for the SDI.\\n\\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\\'t even\\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\\'t take a decade or more\\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\\ndidn\\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\\'re not going to\\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\\naerospace transportation is real.\\n\\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\\nrelationship.\\n\\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\\n\\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\\nyes - we\\'ll make a little money off it too!\\n\\n     Then - and only then - we\\'ll spend another three years to\\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \\nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\\'s next step to the stars!\\n\\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\\'s first rockets weren\\'t Saturn\\nV\\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\\nhand!', u\"Hi Folks,\\n\\n   Does anyone have a copy of Playmation they'd be willing to sell me.

In addition, many stand alone\\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\\n\\n\\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\\n\\n\\tEndeavour\\'s June flight and Discovery\\'s July mission both will include\\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\\nHuntsville, Ala.\\n\\n\\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\\ntrainers.\\n\\n\\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\\n\\n\\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\\nbecome necessary.', u'\\nI am in the market for a 24-bit graphics card for a PC (ISA bus), and\\nwas wondering if anyone had any comments (good? bad? otherwise?) regarding\\nthe Diamond Stealth 24?  \\n', u'Let\\'s say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a\\nboat, but it could be anything.

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse.

Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.

Science is a human activity and as such,\\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\\nactivity.

Considering\\n: the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\\n\\n: So, back to the original question:\\n\\n: And objective morality is.....?\\n\\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \\nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\\nobjective sense.\\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\\ninfinitely malleable, doesn\\'t mean that the objective standard itself\\ndoesn\\'t exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

As he said himself:\\n\\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\\n   superficially_of_God\\'s_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God\\'s_will,_and_\\n   not_let_God\\'s_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n   For God\\'s will gave men their form, their essence, and their\\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\\n   Lord\\'s creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\\n\\n   [...]\\n\\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\\n\\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\\nwrong.  It\\'s also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \\nto believe in God.  We certainly can\\'t conclude that he\\'s an atheist, \\nthough.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The Bible proves it\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIn the Bible it says that...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\\n\\'truth\\' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn\\'t to say that The\\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\\naccepted.\\n\\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage \\'means\\' one thing and\\none thing only is not legitimate.\\n\\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\\n\\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Pascal\\'s Wager\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\\nbut if you don\\'t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis argument is known as Pascal\\'s Wager.  It has several flaws.\\n\\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y\\'s version of hell.\\n\\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you\\'re believing in\\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\\nfavour of prayer.\\n\\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \\nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \\ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \\nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\\n\\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \\nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \\ncost-benefit analysis.\\n\\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\\n\\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one\\'s eternal soul if God does\\n     exist.\\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\\n  4. Therefore it is in one\\'s interest to believe in God.\\n\\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\\nno \"cost\".\\n\\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\\nintended the argument to be viewed.\\n\\nThe biggest reason why Pascal\\'s wager is a failure is that if God is\\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\\nwhether people believe in him.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: What is Occam\\'s Razor?\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nPeople keep talking about Occam\\'s Razor.  What is it?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam\\'s \\nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \\nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\\n\\nNowadays when people refer to Occam\\'s Razor, they generally express it \\nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\\n\\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \\nfor what we see around us:\\n\\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\\n\\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \\nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \\nof non-zero complexity.\\n\\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam\\'s Razor might suggest \\nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\\n\\n3. There isn\\'t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \\nWe just imagine that there is.\\n\\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \\nfind unacceptable.\\n \\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why it\\'s good to believe in Jesus\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nPreaching is not appreciated.\\n\\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\\ntalk.religion.misc).\\n\\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\\nhave them do unto you!\\n\\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\\n\\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you\\'re cleverer than him?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \\nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein\\'s\\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\\nEinstein\\'s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\\n\\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\\n\"I believe in Spinoza\\'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\\nhuman beings.\"\\n\\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\\n\\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\\n\\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\\n\\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\\n   more worthy task...\"\\n\\n\\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\\n   science can reveal it.\"\\n\\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \\nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \\nAlso from the same book:\\n\\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n   it.\"\\n\\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \\nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Everyone worships something\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nEveryone worships something, whether it\\'s money, power or God.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists\\' reactions to (for\\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists\\'.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\\nno smallest member.\\n\\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\\nany particular religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\\ndon\\'t think all this appeared here just by chance?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\\n\\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\\n\\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\\nuniverse and life on earth.\\n\\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\\nsurely it can\\'t have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \\nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\\ndeliberately.\\n\\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\\nposition.\\n\\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \\nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\\n\\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\\n\\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \\nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \\nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \\nuniverse too must have a creator.\\n\\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \\nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \\nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \\ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \\nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\\n\\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \\nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \\nreactor, we wouldn\\'t assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \\nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \\ndifferent part of creation.\\n\\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \\nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \\nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \\nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \\nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \\ninternally inconsistent.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\\nevidence.  For example...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\\nevidence.\\n\\nEarly versions of Josephus\\'s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\\n\\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as \\'the\\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.\\' It is Eusebius who is\\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\\n\\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nGodel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\\nBible to be both true and complete.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nGodel\\'s First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \\nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \\narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \\nvalid or invalid (\\'true\\' or \\'false\\') within that formal system.  (Technically\\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \\nsystem.)\\n\\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \\nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \\nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \\nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\\n\\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\\n\\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \\nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\\n\\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn\\'t tell us anything about\\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\\n\\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\\n\\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\\npresidential primary:\\n\\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\\n\\n GB: \"I guess I\\'m pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\\n      God is important to me.\"\\n\\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\\n\\n GB: \"No, I don\\'t know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\\n      God.\"\\n\\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\\n      of state and church?\"\\n\\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I\\'m just not\\n      very high on atheists.\"\\n\\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\\nstill angry over the remarks.\\n\\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\\n1989.

This concerned a\\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\\n(Bush\\'s phrase).  The following conversation took place:\\n \\n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\\n \\n EM: \"It\\'s bullshit.\"\\n \\n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\\n \\n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\\n \\n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\\n\\n EM: \"You\\'re welcome.\"\\n\\nAfter Bush\\'s election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\\n\\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\\n   supported by the government.\"\\n\\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\\nAtheist Press\\'s Cameron Road address.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: I know where hell is!\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThere are several towns called \"Hell\" in various countries around the\\nworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly\\namusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now \\ngetting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Biblical contradictions wanted\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nDoes anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?\\n\\nResponse:\\n \\nAmerican Atheist Press publish an atheist\\'s handbook detailing Biblical\\ncontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for\\ndetails.\\n\\nThere is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the\\narchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The USA is a Christian nation\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nBecause of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn\\'t the\\nUnited States be considered a Christian nation?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nBased upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear\\nthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some\\nquotes; there are many more.\\n\\n  \"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert\\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\\n   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\\n   needs them not.\"\\n      - James Madison, \"A Memorial and Remonstrance\", 1785\\n\\n  \"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\"\\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\\n\\n  \"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\\n   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of\\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose.\"\\n\\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\\n\\n  \"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\\n   above it.\"\\n\\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from \"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\",\\n        Nov. 20, 1728\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nNo.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\\n\\n   Article 11\\n\\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\\n\\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\\nsuch as Charles Bevans\\' \"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\\nUnited States of America 1776-1949\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\\n\\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on\\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was\\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\\n\\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it\\'s hard to say.\\n\\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\\nquotation.\\n', u'\\nThis was known as *Journey to the Far Side of the Sun* in the United\\nStates and as *Doppelganger* in the U.K.  It was produced by the great\\nteam of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (whose science was usually a bit\\nbetter than this).  It may have been their first production using live\\nactors-- they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows,\\nsuch as *Supercar*, *Stingray*, and *Thunderbirds*.  Later, they went\\non to do more live-action SF series: *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.\\n\\nThe astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, VTOL\\nairliners, and mighty Portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to\\nlook at.', u\"SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\\n\\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \\n\\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \\ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \\ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \\nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \\nconstellation.  \\n\\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \\nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\\n\\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\\n\\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \\non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \\ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \\nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \\nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\\n\\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\\nare spent on astronauts.\\n\\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \\nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\\n\\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \\nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\\norbits.\\n\\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \\nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \\nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\\n\\n\", u': Exodus 21:22-25:\\n\\n:        22 And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with\\n:           child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further\\n:           injury, he shall surely be fined as the woman\\'s husband may\\n:           demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide.\\n:        23 But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint\\n:           as a penalty life for life,\\n:        24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\\n:        25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\\n\\n: The most straightforward interpretation of these verses is that if\\n: men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry, the penalty\\n: is only a fine.  If, however, the woman is injured or dies, the\\n: *lex talionis* doctrine of \"an eye for an eye\" applies.  This is the\\n: Jewish interpretation, and is supported by Jewish commentaries on\\n: these verses.\\n:    This is quite an embarrassment for pro-lifer Christians, so there is\\n: of course an alternate explanation.  The alternative interprets the\\n: word \"miscarriage\" to mean \"premature birth\"--i.e., the child is born\\n: alive--and \"further injury\" to mean injury to either the woman or\\n: the fetus.  This is not a straightforward interpretation, it is not\\n: (so far as I know) supported by any Jewish commentaries, and it does\\n: not appeared to be supported by any other part of the Bible.\\n\\nWhat if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  Did\\nthe ancient Jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (I am\\ntruly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  If there is \\nlittle understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is\\nnot surprising the Bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little\\nreference to nuclear power and contamination.', u': >Based on the amount of E-Mail from fellow Christians who have read the\\n: >posts and told me I was wasting my time with Butler and Joslin, I told\\n: >them I wasn\\'t doing it for DB or  DJ but for other Christians.

Has it ever occured to you that you may be doing more harm\\nthan good to your fellow Christians?\\n\\nBTW, I used to think like Frank does.  I went to a fundamentalist\\nchurch for a while.  I didn\\'t start to really think about what\\nthey were saying until I noticed a \"God\\'s Science\" phamphlet\\nthere.  I read it and noticed that the authors of it knew virtually\\nnothing about Science.  I asked church members some questions about\\n\"theories\" from the phamphlet and got only deceptive answers.  I\\nbegan to notice a very similar style of \"answers\" for theological\\nquestions as well.  The only conclusion I could reach was that\\nthese peoples\\' beliefs about the Bible were about as valid as\\ntheir beliefs in their God\\'s Science phamphlet.\\n\\n: If there are still people out there who think that my purpose here\\n: is to \"attack the Bible,\" (an accusation Frank once made) I would point\\n: out that I have also criticized people who have posted \"bible\\n: contradictions\" that turn out to be silly, out of context, or easily\\n: (and legitimately) reconciled.  I\\'m not attacking the Bible, but \\n: intellectual dishonesty *about* the Bible, from either side.\\n\\nIf one of the primary purposes of Christians is to seek out truth,\\nhow can people condemn you for doing this?\\n', u\"I need to get the specs, or at least a very verbose interpretation of the\\nspecs, for QuickTime.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\\n\\nMark proposed this design, which he calls \"Geode\" (\"rough on the\\noutside, but a gem on the inside\") or the \"ET Strongback with\\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.\"  As you can see from file\\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\\n\\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\\nit can approach closer to the Station\\'s CG and at a structurally strong\\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\\ndocking system.\\n\\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\\nlaunch mass.  We\\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\\'ve never\\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\\n\\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\\'s life to perform a\\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\\ndid with Skylab).\\n\\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\\n\\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\\ndone to date.\\n\\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\\'s committee in Crystal City,\\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\nseems more likely.\\n\\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\\'s design;\\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \\n\\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

The purpose of the conference was to\\npublish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed\\nto prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it\\nbacked away from the \"Family Values\" positons of the \\'92 convention.\\n\\nConservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson\\'s organization\\nwith political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications\\nsupport.\\n\\nThe Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version\\nof the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.\\nMs. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom\\nCouncil in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.\\n\\nMs. Elwell was hired by Domino\\'s Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989\\nto manage Legatus, a \"nonpolitical\", Catholic businessmen\\'s group.\\nMembership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4\\nmillion in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts\\nat Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the\\nCatholic Campaign.\\n\\nThe Campaign\\'s list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.\\nRobert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely\\nPat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national\\ncommittee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson\\'s\\nAmerican Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas\\nPatrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson\\'s ACLJ, is also an\\nactive supporter of the Catholic Campaign.\\n\\nThe board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec\\nand former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank\\nLynch, former Reagan official Richard V.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\\n\\n    If you don\\'t want to see the FAQ, add \\'Frequently Asked Questions\\' to\\nyour KILL file for this group (if you\\'re not reading this with a newsreader\\nthat can kill articles by subject, you\\'re out of luck).\\n\\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.\\n\\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\\n\\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\\n\\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\\n\\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\\n    discussion.\\n\\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\\n\\n    Hope you aren\\'t surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\\n\\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\\n\\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\\n    FAQ postings.\\n\\n\\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\\n\\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you\\'re on Usenet.\\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\\n    Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you\\'re taking a tangent.\\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth\\n\\t100 posts).\\n    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST\\n\\tnot SPACE.\\n    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all\\n\\treferences.)\\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you\\'re\\n\\tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!\\n    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail\\n\\tor article), state your institution, etc. Don\\'t assume the\\n\\t\\'reply\\' function of mailers will work.\\n    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don\\'t post what everyone\\n\\twill get on TV anyway.\\n    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:\\n\\tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals\\n\\t(use carriage returns).\\n\\n\\n    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS\\n\\n    I\\'ve attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn\\'t\\n    a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each\\n    posting.

They are certainly useable as they are, but\\nare missing some higher-level functionality.

They\\nare fairly simple, but I\\'ve found them to be very fast (for my purposes,\\nanyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a\\n\"virtual screen\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with\\nno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy\\nareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I\\'ve also included a\\nsimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256\\ncolor GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick\\'n\\'dirty(tm) demo program\\nthat bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three \"windows\".\\n\\nThe whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip \\nIt is zipped with pkzip 2.04g\\n\\nIt is completely in the public domain, as far as I\\'m concerned.

But we\\'ll look\\nat your defense of this later.\\n \\nAlso, the \"reward of iniquity\" in the Acts PASSAGE may not be the 30 pieces of\\nsilver in Matthew\\'s PASSAGES.  (Although you have a valiant attempt later at\\nstating why you believe it is).\\n \\nAt this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some Scriptural\\ngroundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"Of course the only reason I can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage\\nas he has done with Judas\\' death, is to make it agree with another passage so\\nthat both could be considered correct.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nOne of the reasons I have given a different exegetical view of the passages is\\nthat you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these\\npassages are complimentary.  However, I see no problem in Tony Rose\\'s\\nexplanation of Judas\\' death...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nHOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING\\nHIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND \"FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN\"\\n=============================================================\\n \\nThis question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are\\nconstantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent\\ndiscrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.\\nSome have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is\\ndestroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at\\nall.\\nMatthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and\\nwas crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do\\nthey necessarily contradict each other?\\nMatthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that\\nJudas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling\\nsomething black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be\\ntrue and supplementary.\\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\\nthis way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are\\nnot told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced\\nwas the decomposition of his body before his fall.\\nLouis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.\\nThis individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a\\npistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at\\nthe same time.\\nOn the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting\\nhimself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping\\nform the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the\\ncase of Matthew\\'s and Peter\\'s accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a\\nsituation of different perspectives of the same event.\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nYour only reason for rejecting this is, I believe, your attempt to discredit\\ninerrancy.  You haven\\'t related how this is IMPOSSIBLE or highly unlikely.\\nHere\\'s what you said in an earlier post...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nDB [quoting Tony Rose]...\\n \\n\"The added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so\\nopposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  But you seem to\\nfind Tony Rose\\'s eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting David\\nJoslin\\'s.\"\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nHere, you discredit Tony\\'s explanation based on what you deem too \"heavy\" for\\nthe passages.  But you haven\\'t addressed why you feel that way.  You can say\\nit\\'s a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn\\'t tell me it\\ndidn\\'t happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.\\n \\nQuestions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or\\nare either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an\\nalleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe\\nin this respect.\\n \\nDB...\\n\"At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:\\n \\n \\nActually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer\\nit because he now restricts himself to two points.

One\\nsimply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew\\'s version as\\nthe correct version in both Matt and Acts.  \"The Biblical Knowledge Commentary\"\\nsuggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly\\nexploded (which doesn\\'t explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope\\nbroke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn\\'t explain\\nhow a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nThe outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person\\nwas suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may\\nhave deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell\\nupon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a\\nsuperficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not\\ngiven a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted\\npost gave us some...\\n \\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nA possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the\\nedge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there\\nfor some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas\\nfell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.\\nThe fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this\\nexplanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the\\nvalley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see\\nrocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.\\nThere are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\nTherefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on\\nthis way down, tearing his body open.\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\n \\nDB...\\nNow truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the\\nsource of the Potter\\'s field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is\\ncorrect: Matthew does make that confusion.

I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\\nmention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\\nwhat act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\\nJudas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\\nthat when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\ndiscusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\nit was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nDave, we are getting somewhere, aren\\'t we!\\n \\nACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples\\n(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,\\nACT 1:16 \"Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy\\nSpirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide\\nto those who arrested Jesus;\\nACT 1:17 \"for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.\"\\nACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and\\nfalling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.\\nACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field\\nis called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)\\nACT 1:20 \"For it is written in the book of Psalms: \\'Let his dwelling place be\\ndesolate, And let no one live in it\\'; and, \\'Let another take his office.\\'\\n \\nNotice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.

I haven\\'t attempted to\\ndefine the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of\\neach Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a\\nsimilar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is\\neasy to anthropomorphize with these animals.

My opinion (for what it is worth)\\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don\\'t think that the\\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\\n\\nI\\'ve had some more thoughts on my definitions:\\n\\nI\\'ve was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities).

I do\\nnot know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and\\nopen hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know\\nthat\\nhistorically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone\\nby the death penalty.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Khomeini\\'s ruling was not based on the\\nlaw of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was\\nnot offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.\\n\\n\\nI would concur that the thrust of the fatwa (from what I remember) was\\nlevelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication\\nof the book. However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\\nThat were not done and now we have\\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\\n -the program has human interface errors.\\n\\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\\n\\n[ ..deleted.. ]\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome new items follows.\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\\noption than with default option we have.\\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\\n\\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\\n\\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\\n\\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\\ncan say nothing about it.)\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\\n\\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\\n\\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\\n\\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\\nI suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.\", u'\\n\\nReally>`?\\n\\n\\nNo, gravity is an inherent system.  You don\\'t need any excess information\\nother than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively\\ndetermine someone\\'s guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.\\nI agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that\\neverything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that\\nit cannot be objective in theory.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before,\\nthe practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely\\nthe only ones to be considered \"immoral\" under the previous \"definitions\"\\nof the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the\\nclass of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.\\n\\n\\nIt seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system\\nbecause perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would\\nnecessitate some sort of grand design?\\n\\n\\nI think I have.  It is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired\\nbehaviors, etc.  An immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,\\nor destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,\\nimmoral to what end?).', u'Is there an ftp site for maps of the US.  Preferably aerial\\nphotographs?', u'A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.\\nSince he isn\\'t in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post\\nit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n', u\"\\nIf one does not follow the teachings of Christ, he is NOT Christian.  \\nToo easy?  \\n\\n\\nWould you say all Muslims are like Saddam Hussein?

The US Industrial Outlook also \\nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \\nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \\n$450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward \\nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                           \\n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \\nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \\nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \\nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \\nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \\n\\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \\nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \\nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \\nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \\n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \\nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \\nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \\nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \\nbusiness. \\n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \\nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \\nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \\nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \\npublishes a listing of  \"Space Business Indicators\" in mid-year, and \\nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \\nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \\nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \\nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \\n   Looking beyond this year\\'s data, future markets look quite \\npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \\n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \\nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \\nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \\nthrough the mid 1990\\'s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \\nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \\nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \\nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \\nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \\nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don\\'t believe all of the \\ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \\nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \\nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \\nas currently projected.) \\n   It should also be noted this year\\'s DoC data is the first \\nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \\nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \\nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \\nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \\nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \\n\\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \\nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \\nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \\nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \\ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \\nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \\n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \\nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \\nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \\nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \\nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \\nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \\nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \\nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \\ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \\nnegotiation, and not yet final. \\n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \\ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \\nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \\nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \\nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF\\'s Global \\nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \\nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \\nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \\nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \\nUnder this contract the USAF can also request \"launch on demand\" \\nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \\noccur within 40 days of the request. \\n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \\nprovide an excellent business base for MDC\\'s Delta launch program \\nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \\na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \\nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \\nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \\nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \\nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \\n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \\ncontracts.  Motorola\\'s Iridium LEO communications constellation has \\nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \\noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \\nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \\napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \\nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \\n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \\nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \\nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \\nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/\"Spacelifter\" program.  At this \\ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \\nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \\nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \\nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \\nCongress propose cancellation of all \"ELV upgrade\" programs \\n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \"Spacelifter\" \\nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year\\'s budget \\ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \\nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \\n \\n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"\\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \\nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \\nCommerce\\'s Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \\nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \\noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \\nimages of the Earth. \\n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \\nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \\noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \\nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \\nventure as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \\nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \\ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \\ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \\nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \\n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \\n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \\nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \\nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \\nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \\nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \\nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \\n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \\nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \\nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \\nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \\ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \\ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \\nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \\ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \\nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \\nappearing in the next year or so.] \\n                 \\n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD\\'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\" \\n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \\nDynamic\\'s Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \\ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \\nanalyst\\'s report Morgan Stanley said \"We are more than ever \\nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \\n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\\ngenerating unit.\"  Based upon discussions with GD\\'s corporate \\nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \\ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \\n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD\\'s projection of \\ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \\n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \\nhurt General Dynamic\\'s Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \\nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \\nmany market pundits have been speculating GD\\'s space business might \\nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD\\'s Space \\nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \\nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \\nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \\nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \\nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \\nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \\nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \\nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \\nsubstantial losses. \\n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \\nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \\nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \\nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \\nIn GD SSD\\'s case, to get the division back on track, the management \\nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \\nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \\nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \\noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \\ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \\nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \\nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \\nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \\nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \\nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \\n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \\nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \\n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \\nchange for any company.] \\n \\n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \\nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990\\'s.  In early \\nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \\ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \\nnext decade. \\n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \\nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \\ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \\nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics\\' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \\ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas\\' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall\\'s Long \\nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \\n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \\ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \\nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \\nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \\ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \\n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \\nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \\ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \\nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \\nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \\nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today\\'s average level, to \\nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \\n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \\nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \\ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \\nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \\ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \\nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \\nor near-term transponders. \\n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \\nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \\nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \\ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \\noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \\nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \\nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \\n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \\nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \\nComparing the two surveys, there aren\\'t outstanding differences in \\nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \\ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \\ntransponders on orbit.\\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \\nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \\nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \\ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \\ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \\nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \\nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \\nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \\ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \\nmillions or billions of dollars.  \\n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \\nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \\nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \\ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \\nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \\nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \\nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \\ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \\nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \\nhandle the increase in traffic. \\n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \\ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \\nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \\ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \\non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \\nlast generation\\'s satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \\ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \\nlaunches over longer intervals. \\n   And as last note; Arianespace didn\\'t flag it this year, but it \\nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \\ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \\nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \\nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \\nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \\nJapan\\'s H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\\'s Proton capable of 8, and other \\nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \\nyear.  That\\'s a lot of capability for a small market. \\n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \\nlaunches.]\\n\\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \\n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \\nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \\nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \\nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \\nof range safety rules.  \\n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \\ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \\ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \\nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \\nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \\noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \\ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \\nvalid abort call. \\n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \\ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \\ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \\nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \\n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \\nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \\ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \\nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \\ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \\nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \\nin the launch. \\n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \\ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \\nby the Department of Commerce\\'s Office of Commercial Space \\nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \\n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \\ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \\nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \\ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \\nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \\ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \\nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \\nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \\nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \\nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \\nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \\nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \\nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \\ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \\nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \\nlaunch.  \\n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \\nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \\nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \\nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \\ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \\n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \\nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \\nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \\nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \\n\\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \\nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \\nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"Aerokosmos\" \\nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \"Severkosmos\", \\nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \\nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \\nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \\nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \\nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \\n\\'Sineva\\'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \\nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \\nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \\nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \\nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \\n   [Commentary: There\\'s very little released information on this new \\nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \\nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \\nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \\ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \\n   This one\\'s a little different in that they are offering variants \\nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can\\'t identify any key customers being \\ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\\n\\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \\nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \\nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \\nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \\nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \\nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \\nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \\nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \\nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \\n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \\nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \\nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \\nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \\nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \\nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \\n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \\nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \\nsufficient to recover setup costs?\\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \\ninvestment?  \\n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \\nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \\nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \\nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \\non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\\n\\n9- SPAIN\\'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \\nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \\nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \\nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \\nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \\nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \\nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \\na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \\nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \\nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \\nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \\ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina\\'s Condor \\nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \\n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \\nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \\npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \\nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \\nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \\nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \\nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \\nsystem).  \\n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \\nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \\nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \\nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \\nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \\nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \\nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \\nfunding for hardware. \\n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \\nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \\nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \\nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \\nthe country in the 1970\\'s and early 1980\\'s. \\n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \\ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \\ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \\nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \\nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \\nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \\nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \\nin the mid-1980\\'s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \\ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \\nlagged that of the propulsion system. \\n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \\nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \\nsatellite will study the Earth\\'s upper atmosphere and includes \\ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \\nyet been selected, but OSC\\'s Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \\nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \\ncontract.] \\n\\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \\nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \\nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro\\'s PA-2 \\nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \\nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \\nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \\noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \\nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \\nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \\nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \"the main \\nalternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service \\nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \\nSwedish satellite was not specified. \\n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \\nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \\nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \\nPacAstro\\'s literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \\nrockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the Lunar \\nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \\n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \\n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \\nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \\n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \\nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \\nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \\nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \\nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \\nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \\nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \\nboard of directors.  \\n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \\n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \\nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \\ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \\n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \\nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \\nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \\nhardware.] \\n\\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \\nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \\nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \\nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \\nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \\nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \\ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \\nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \\nsatellite\\'s communications channels.  \\n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \\nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \\nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \\nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \\nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \\nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \\nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \\nM) through 2006.  \\n   I haven\\'t been able to establish any relationship between this \\nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \\nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \\ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \\nseparate sastellite ventures. \\n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \"Asiasat-\\n2\", but I don\\'t thinks this has any relationship with the existing \\nHong Kong-based \"Asiasat\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \\nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \\nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \\nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \\nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \\nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \\nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \\nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \\nproceed. \\n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \\nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \\nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \\n\\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\\n   South Korea\\'s Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \\nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \\nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \\nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \\nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \\nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \\n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea\\'s \\naerospace technology to the level of the world\\'s top 10 countries by \\n2000.                                 \\n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \\nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \\nactivities. I\\'m noting this as a flag that potential new players are \\ncoming into the commercial space market. \\n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \\nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \\non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \\ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \\nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \\n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \\nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \\n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \\nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \"made in Korea.\"  \\nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \\n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \\nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \\nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \\ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \\noptical and microwave sensors.\\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \\nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \\nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \\ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \\nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \\nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \\nKorean peninsula.       \\n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \\nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \\naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \\noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \\npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \\nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \\nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \\nannounced teaming for production of OSC\\'s Orbcomm user terminals.).  \\n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \\nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \\nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \\nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \\nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \\n\\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \\nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \\ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \\nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \\nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \\nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \\ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \\nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \\nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \\ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \\nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \\nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \\nresults in all of 1993.

I\\nhave seen the film called \"The Gay Agenda\" and along with my church we found\\nit to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of\\neditting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia\\nfamiliar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people\\nare actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither\\nyou nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as\\nmany as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life\\nI have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something\\nobviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are\\ninnately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an\\nabolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not\\nsupport wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian\\nFundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants\\nyour report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed\\nhomosexuality from it\\'s list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that\\nthere are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.\\nI do not feel threatened by gays, I don\\'t understand why others are.\\n\\nThe following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-\\nistries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.\\n\\nTHE FOUNDER OF AN \"EX-GAY\" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO\\n\\nby Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)\\n\\nIn December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate\\'s homophobia rewaa\\nawards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE\\nINDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering\\ndiscontented gays and lesbians \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\\nthrough prayer.  \"I\\'d like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laughs, \"I\\'m\\nno longer deserve it.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peaked\\nwith his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well\\nas Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-\\ngay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  \"There\\'s no reality\\nin it,\" he says, \"I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.\"\\n  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the\\norganizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again\\nChristianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who\\nare just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their\\nsexual urges and embracing Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\\nseeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explains Bob Davies, director of\\nExodus.  He ventures that \"about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-\\nsexuality are men.\"\\n  \"Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting\\ntheir time,\" says Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeemed lesbian\" who worked with\\nCaligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\\norganizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.\"\\n  \"It\\'s possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" says sex educator\\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. \"But it\\'s really impossible to\\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,\\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.\"\\n  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all\\nhell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both\\ntheir romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted\\nby a man he picked up in a bar.  \"I was really drunk,\" he recalls, \"and I\\nwent home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all\\nnight, and the next morning he raped me again.\"\\n  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the\\nhome he shared with his ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\\nCaligiuri recalls.  \"I thought at this time, \\'If this is what being gay is\\nabout, I don\\'t want to be this way anymore.\"\\n  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery\\nwith others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\\'s\\ngay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its\\nfirst public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,\\nFree Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed\\nfor hell.\\n  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks\\nin part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  \"We were listed\\nunder Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,\" Caligiuri says, \"so people\\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\\nwhere the local bars were, and we\\'d preach to them about the sins of homo-\\nsexuality.\"  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,\\nadding, \"They\\'ll do anything to reach these people.\"\\n  \"David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,\" recalls Peter\\nKelly, a counselor at Phoenix\\'s Catholic diocese AIDS program, \"like that\\nhe knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\'s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on\\nRaphael\\'s syndicated talk show in 1985.  \"They were relieved,\" he recalls.\\n\"They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better\\nthat I should be a \\'reformed\\' gay person.\"\\n  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  \"By the time I appeared on Sally\\'s\\nshow,\" \"I\\'d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\\nfather.  I was horny all the time.\"\\n  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his\\nnumerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he \"used to go to bookstores\\nand get blowjobs.\"  When he wasn\\'t working the bookstores, he was sleeping\\nwith other \"reformed\" homosexuals.\\n  \"I didn\\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex\\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri says.  \"We\\'d go to conferences in other cities,\\nand we\\'d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody\\nelse.\"\\n  By the time he appeared on \\'AM Philadelphia\\' television show in May 1988,\\nCaligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show\\'s\\nhost asked him if he ever \"acted on temptation,\" his answer was a lie.\\n  Caligiuri\\'s duplicity began to take it\\'s toll on him, however.  He was\\nsuffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating\\nyeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  \"I was too sick\\nto go to church,\" he explains.  \"The more time I spent away from those people\\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.\"\\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local\\nchurch and closed the ministry\\'s doors.  \"I\\'d convinced myself that there\\nis no need in the world for ex-gay people,\" he says.\\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (\"I\\'m interest-\\ned in belief systems that aren\\'t judgemental.\"), considering romance (\"But\\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.\\n\"I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,\" he says.  \"I want to\\neventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\\nmay have brought to our community.\"\\n\\n---end article---\\n\\nCaligiuri\\'s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles\\nof former leaders and founders of \\'ex-gay\\' ministries who have said very similar th\\nsimilar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have\\ncome to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,\\nlike Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazarus Project\" of West\\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community\\nto bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values\\nof sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become\\nand become close friends with many who once attended such groups as \"Love In\\nAction\" and others, who either once claimed to have been \"reformed\" or who\\nwere too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed\\nin them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of \"sealing\" their\\nnew heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses\\nand bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of\\nnight and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous \"sin\"\\nthrough a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch\\nhas dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-\\ncent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet\\nthe church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow\\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also\\nmrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and\\nfear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on\\nthem, they may even opt for \\'suicide\\' or surgical dampering of the brain\\nfunctions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-\\nplace.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the\\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington\\'s\\n_\"Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact\\nbased books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as\\nMaury Johnston\\'s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser\\'s _Come Hom!_.  I\\nseriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and\\nself-acceptance.', u'Is it not the case that, in the eyes of the law, when someone is aware of\\nsomething and has the capability of taking action and does not, that individual\\nmay be held responsible for that action?\\n\\nExample: the driver of a getaway car may be held as an accomplice to murder.\\n\\t The \"I didn\\'t know\" defense spawned the \"ignorance of the law is no excuse\"\\n\\nWhen an individual is held as a material witness to a crime, is there a criminal\\ncharge against the individual?

It would be ideal if\\nwe could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then\\ndetermine which course of thought suits us best.  But again, this is not\\npossible.  Not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with\\nit some psychological benefits.  There are also some psychological\\nburdens, too.\\n\\n\\nWell, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism,\\nthey could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually \"believing\"\\nin racism.  Of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you\\noriginated it.', u'Some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same\\ndirection.  (ie: On a closed cube, all normals point outwards).  You can use\\nthe points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making\\nsure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.\\n\\nHow do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a \\nset of points, edges and faces?   Say that you had a cube with all faces that \\nhave their normals facing outwards, except for one face.  What\\'s the\\nbest way to realize that face is \"flipped\", and should have it\\'s points\\nre-ordered?   I thought I had a good way of telling this, but then realized\\nthat the algorithm I had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise\\norder for a 2d polygon.  I\\'d like something for 3d data.\\n\\nAny hints, tips, references would be appreciated.\\n\\nSteve', u'\\n[lotsa stuff taken out]\\n\\nBottom line: due process was not served.

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.

Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\\n\\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \\n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\\n\\n  Contact:\\n  Rodney Hoinkes\\n  Head of Design Applications\\n  Centre for Landscape Research\\n  University of Toronto\\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\\n\\n==========================================================================\\n\\nEnd of Resource Listing', u': \\n: Where could I find a description of the JPG file format?

I was referring to the fact\\nthat far more aeronautical development took place in the \\'30\\'s.  For much\\nof the \\'20\\'s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the\\nindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.

They profits from the voyage would then be\\nshared.\\n\\n\\n  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a\\nMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations\\ncan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),\\nOrteig\\'s prize, Lord Northcliffe\\'s prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in\\n1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were\\nwithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well\\nwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only\\na gov\\'t could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.\\n  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by\\ntaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane\\nthat could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions\\nasked.\\n', u'\\nWill someone tell an ignorant physicist where the term \"Level 5\" comes\\nfrom?

Send mail to\\n\\n        archive-server@siggraph.org\\n\\n        and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send\\n        followed by the topic and subtopic you wish. A good place to start is\\n        with the command\\n             send index\\n        which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.\\n\\n        Additions/corrections/suggestions may be directed to the admin,\\n        \"bibadmin@siggraph.org\".\\n\\nImage Manipulation Libraries:\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nUtah Raster Toolkit - nice image manipulation tools.\\nPBMPLUS - a great package for image conversion and manipulation.\\nLIBTIFF - library for reading/writing TIFF images.\\nImageMagick - X11 package for display and interactive manipulation\\n\\tof images.

Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\\n\\n   If you don\\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\\'t set up\\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\\n   problem.\\n\\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you\\'ll find the latest\\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\\n\\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.

There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\\n\\n5.

(Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.

There are two such organizations: \\nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\\n\\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \\norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \\nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \\n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\\n\\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\\n\\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\\'\\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \\n\\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"F\" motor are exempt from\\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\\nC, for details.\\n\\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\\n\\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\\n\\n\\nWhy not?

Their mark is on their face\\nthe sing of prostrafion; this is their similitude in\\nthe Torah and Indgil.\" [the Our\\'an 48:28-29]\\n\\n   Since the Nineteenth and Thirhy-first Words\\nconcerning the mission of Muhammad (SAW) prove his\\nprophethood with decisive evidences, we assign the\\nverification of that subject to those Words.\\n   As a supplement to them, we will merely show here\\nin Nineteen Signs, some  of the flashes of that great\\ntruth.\\n\\n   FIRST SIGN:  The Owner and Master of this universe\\ndoes everything with knowledge, disposes every affair\\nwith wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats\\neverything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with\\nHis will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that\\nare apparent to us.  Since the One who creates knows,\\nsurely the One who knows will speak, since He will\\nspeak, surely He will speak to those who have\\nconsciousness, thought, and speech.  Since He will speak\\nto those who have thought, surely He will speak to\\nhumankind, whose make-up and awareness are more\\ncomprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will\\nspeak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most\\nperfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and\\nhighest in morality, and who are qualified to guide\\nhumanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW), \\nwho, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest \\ncharacter and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth\\nof humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has\\nsubmitted, with the radiance of whose light has been\\nillumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to\\nwhom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity,\\nrenew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for\\nwhose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call\\ndown Allah\\'s blessings and bear admiration and love in\\ntheir hearts.\\n\\n   Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW),\\nand Indeed He has done so;  He will make him the\\nMessenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make\\nhim the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He\\nhas done so.\\n', u'Archive-name: space/diff\\n\\nDIFFS SINCE LAST FAQ POSTING (IN POSTING ORDER)\\n\\n(These are hand-edited context diffs; do not attempt to use them to patch\\nold copies of the FAQ).\\n\\n===================================================================\\ndiff -t -c -r1.18 FAQ.intro\\n*** /tmp/,RCSt1a06400\\tThu Apr  1 14:47:22 1993\\n--- FAQ.intro\\tThu Apr  1 14:46:55 1993\\n***************\\n*** 101,107 ****\\n\\t\\t  NASA Langley (Technical Reports)\\n\\t\\t  NASA Spacelink\\n\\t\\t  National Space Science Data Center\\n-\\t\\t  Space And Planetary Image Facility\\n\\t\\t  Space Telescope Science Institute Electronic Info.

The fact is, there are *two* references to\\nJesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least\\nbeen altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that\\nJosephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage\\nsays the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the\\nJews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho\\nfor Jesus and may be authentic.\\n   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference\\nto Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which\\nlack the references.\\n\\nIt is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but\\nI don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in\\nthe scholarly community that this is the case.

Suppose\\nfurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by any\\nnation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country\\nat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the\\nUS see fit.  The US would be militarily \"omnipotent\".\\n\\nBut suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not\\ninterfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current\\ncivil war in the former Yugoslavian states.\\n\\nTechnically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to \\nunilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But\\neffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy \\nof non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to\\nstrongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would\\never be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it\\ncould actually do, although it had the power to do \"whatever it wanted\".\\nThe US would simply \"never want to interfere\" for such an idea would\\nbe beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate\\nnon-interference policy.\\n\\nGod is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but\\nHe cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what\\nHe, Himself is.\\n\\nI hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning\\nomnipotence.\\n\\nRegards,', u'SOmebody mentioned  a re-boost of HST during this mission,  meaning\\nthat Weight is a very tight  margin on this  mission.\\n\\nHow will said re-boost be done?\\n\\nGrapple, HST,  stow it in Cargo bay,  do OMS burn to high altitude,  \\n\\nunstow  HST,   repair  gyros,  costar install,  fix solar arrays,\\n\\nthen return to earth?\\n\\nMy guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost?\\n\\nwhy not  grapple,  do all said fixes,   bolt a small  liquid  fueled\\nthruster module  to  HST,   then let it make the re-boost.  it has to be\\ncheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug.   that way, now that\\nthey are going to need at least 5  spacewalks,  then they can carry\\nan EDO pallet,  and  sit on station and even  maybe do the  solar array\\ntilt  motor  fix.', u'\\nSecular laws seem to value criminal life more than the victims life,\\nIslam places the rights of society and every member in it above \\nthe rights of the individual, this is what I call true human rights.\\n\\n\\nAs a Muslim living in a non-Muslim land I am bound by the laws of the land\\nI live in, but I do not disregard Islamic Law it still remains a part of my \\nlife.

To summarize:\\n  \\nSPACE ADVERTISING\\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\\'s logos on the\\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\\na 10\\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\\'s which looked at\\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\\nwould scan past it.)\\n  \\nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s upcoming movie \"The Last\\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\\nmain fuselage of the mission\\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\\ncoming from NASA.)\\n  \\nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".

Hmm, what about used computers?\\n\\nCheers,\\nKent', u'Let me begin by saying I think this is the world\\'s first religion to use\\nthe net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this\\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \\ncommon.\\n\\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible\\'s\\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\nStory of Adam and Eve:\\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \\nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\\n\\nTraditional Philosophy:\\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it\\'s OK. This\\nis why married women usually didn\\'t work until recent decades.\\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \\nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \\nquestion by ordinary people, who can\\'t make decisions for themselves.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\\n\\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \\nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \\nthemselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\\n\\n1990\\'s philosophy:\\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \\n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\\n\\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \\nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\\n\\nLessons from new interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\\nis ideal.\\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \\nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\\nlife for their children (and themselves).\\n\\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\\nEve\\'s decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind\\'s first good decision, instead\\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \\nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \\nuntil it was actively sought.\\n\\n---End serious discussion.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nJohn Bradley\\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\\nGIF, and other image formats.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? is the\\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.

You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].

The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n', u'\\n   >\\tIf the  new  Kuiper belt object *is*  called \\'Karla\\', the next\\n   >one  should be called \\'Smiley\\'.\\n\\n   Unless I\\'m imaging things, (always a possibility =) 1992 QB1, the Kuiper Belt\\n   object discovered last year, is known as Smiley.\\n\\nAs it happens the _second_ one is Karla.

I mean, it\\'s okay to say\\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\\n     not some metaphor for something else.\\n\\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \\n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\\n\\n     Further, belief in God isn\\'t a bar to evil.  Let\\'s\\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\\n     in God to justify this belief.

Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

How do I become an astronaut?\\n\\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably\\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\\n    specialist\".\\n\\n    If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough\\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\\n    you should be okay; if you can\\'t, your chances are poor.\\n\\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\\n    appearance and actions; you\\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\\'s image is very prim and\\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\\n    Keep your nose clean.\\n\\n    Get a pilot\\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;\\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\\n\\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\\n\\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\\n    to demonstrate motivation.\\n\\n    Keep trying.

NASA is now accepting on a\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\n\\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\n    considered.\\n\\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\n    program.\\n\\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\\n    ---------------------------------\\n\\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\n    flight crew.\\n\\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\n\\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\\n    astronauts.\\n\\n    Pilot Astronaut\\n\\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\n    payload operations.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\\n\\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\n    experimental operations.\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ===========================\\n\\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\\n    --------------------------------\\n\\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\\n    submitting an application.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\\n\\n    1.

Helps will be appreciated... thanx', u\"\\nI was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science\\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus.

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.

In\\n    general, however, systems connected to \\'the net\\' fall in one of three\\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\\n    special \\'servers\\'.\\n\\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\\n\\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\\n\\n    A second mechanism is Usenet \\'netnews\\'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\\n    \\'group name\\'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\\n    called \\'sci.space.news\\', \\'sci.space\\', \\'sci.space.shuttle\\', \\'sci.astro\\',\\n    and \\'talk.politics.space\\'. Contributors \\'post\\' submissions (called\\n    \\'articles\\' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\\n    posted.\\n\\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\\n    it the preferred option.\\n\\nMAILING LISTS\\n\\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\\n    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body\\n    should be in the format \\'subscribe space John Public\\') to join. Note\\n    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of\\n    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are\\n    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve\\n\\tjulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README\\n    for further details.\\n\\n    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle\\n    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line\\n    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources\\n    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.\\n\\n    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning\\n    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems.

Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.\\n\\n    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;\\n    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid\\n    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to\\n    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and\\n    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from\\n    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,\\n    or by email to space-tech-request if you don\\'t have FTP access.\\n\\n    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and\\n    Development of Space and other interested parties.

Email saying \"INDEX SEDS-L\" to list the archive contents.\\n\\n    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status\\n    reports, and the like.

(I\\'m also using Mode X, 320x240).\\n\\nI\\'ve run into two problems; I\\'m sure that other readers have tried this\\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\\n\\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I\\'m\\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\\n\\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\\nshape?\\n\\nCurrently I take:\\n\\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\\n\\nand produce:\\n            \\n             1  2  3  4\\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\\n                                    61 62 63 64\\n\\nLine 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.\\nLine 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.\\nThis fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But\\nit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?\\nPerhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap\\nalready skewed?\\n\\nAre there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?\\nI was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.\\nLocations are stored in (x,y,z) form.\\n\\n[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)\\n*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to\\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\\'t have to\\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I\\'ve decided that this\\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\\na real perspective drawing.\\n\\nHopefully the \"context\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\\n\\nThanks in advance for any help.\\n', u':P>My atheism is incidental, and the question of \"God\" is trivial.\\n:P\\n:P>But........\\n:P\\n:P>It matters a great deal to me when idiots try to force their belief on me,\\n:P>when they try to enforce their creation myths to be taught as scientific\\n:P>fact in school, when they tell me I can have no morals because morals are\\n:P>from \"God\", when a successful presidential candidate says that an atheist\\n:P>shouldn\\'t be considered a citizen and couldn\\'t be patriotic because \"after\\n:P>all this is one nation under God\", when the fundies try to take over the\\n:P>party that may well provide the next President of The United States of\\n:P>America so that they can force their beliefs on the rest of the country,\\n:P>et cetera..........\\n:P\\n:P>That\\'s why I subscribe to alt.atheism.\\n:P\\n:P>And in the middle of this, people who aren\\'t mind readers pop up on\\n:P>alt.atheism to tell me what I do or don\\'t believe, or to concoct some\\n:P>straw-man reason why I don\\'t share their particular belief.\\n:P\\n:P>You think I should just accept this?\\n:P\\n:P>This isn\\'t particularly a dig at fundamentalist christians.

But one that is unstable and hence a source of serious worry.\\n\\nJoseph Askew\\n\", u'\\n\\n\\nI think that you are changing the meaning of \"values\" here. Perhaps\\nit is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.\\n\\nvalue n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods\\nor service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in \\nusefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality\\nconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as\\nof a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. \\nThe relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or\\nlightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech\\nsound. \\n\\nIn context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms\\nof scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that\\nthese definitions do not mean the same thing.\\n\\nIn my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a\\nreach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the\\nword \"value\" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard\\nof measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its\\nbasis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one\\nconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on\\nsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a\\nscientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as\\n\"objective values.\"\\n\\nBack to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.\\nJust because the word \"values\" is used in both contexts does not mean\\nthat there is a relationship between the two contexts.\\n\\nIf one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\\nfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\\nthe meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\\n\\nSo, back to the original question:\\n\\nAnd objective morality is.....?\\n\\nIf you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will\\nbe a good beginning.\\n', u'They must be shipping that good Eau Clair acid to California now.', u'Ps.92:12: \"The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.\"', u'\\nAlso in pure speculation:\\n\\nParity errors in memory or previously known conditions that were waivered.\\n   \"Yes that is an error, but we already knew about it\"\\n\\nAny problem where they decided a backup would handle it.\\n\\nAny problem in an area that was not criticality 1,2,3..., that is, any\\n   problem in a system they decided they could do without.\\n\\nI\\'d be curious as to what the real meaning of the quote is.', u'[deletions]\\n\\nIf this is grounded firmly in Islam, as you claim, then you have just\\nexposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism, plain and simple.\\n\\nWhether you like it or not, whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or\\nnot, there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear\\nof their life for words.\\n\\nIt simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the\\nworst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs, got that?\\nYou do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do, you\\nquite simply admit the backruptcy of your position.

I\\'m not a Jew but I understand that this is the\\nJewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between\\nYHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral\\nCode to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries\\nfall, though.\\n\\nAs I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was\\nrequired, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that\\nthe Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of\\nthe required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).\\n\\nThe essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between\\nMan and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate\\nanything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).\\n\\n\\nThe trouble with all of this is that we don\\'t really know what the \"created\\nin His image\" means. I\\'ve heard a number of different opinions on this and\\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ\\'s example, we know very little about\\nJesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives\\nby his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.\\nRevelation aside, one can only \"know\" Christ second-hand or worse.\\n\\nThis is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way\\ninitially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible\\nto interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where\\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\\n\\n\\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:', u'', u'\\n   {Description of \"External Tank\" option for SSF redesign deleted}\\n\\n\\nYo Ken, let\\'s keep on-top of things! Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.', u'Hey!?

However, the\\nconcept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I \\nsuspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic \\nbenefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a\\nhuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic\\nbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed\\nand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the \\nequivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billion\\nfor a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done\\nthan because they expect to make money off the deal.\", u'Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their\\nERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive\\nstrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\\nor 75 Statute miles.\\n\\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \\nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\\nsection column.  \\n\\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \\nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\\n\\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\\n\\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\\n\\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n', u'     \\n\\nDoes anybody have Bobby\\'s post in which he said something like \"I don\\'t\\nknow why there are more men than women in islamic countries.

If I\\ndon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.\\n\\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\\nlow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \\nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\\nbillion for the US share.\\n\\nI didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that\\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\\nthat's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or\\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round\\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and\\nequipment would weigh?\\n\\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?

Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \\nI've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\\nDC-1.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\", u'I addressed most of the key issues in this very long (284 lines) post\\nby Dean Kaflowitz in two posts yesterday.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\\nrocket ship.\\n\\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\\nmid-June.\\n\\n        Although there wasn\\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\\nagencies.\\n\\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\\nchanges in SDI\\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\\n\\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO\\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\\nprogram. \"I didn\\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\\n\\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\\'s orbital\\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\\nevolutionary technology developments.\\n\\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\\nshowed how today\\'s engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\\nparents\\' time.\"\\n\\n        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\\n\\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\\ncrucial. \"It\\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\\n\\n        SDIO\\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\\nwe\\'re going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\\'s\\nDemocratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\\'t\\nsustainable....NASA hasn\\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\\n\\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\\'s Republican colleague, went further.\\nJoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\\nwere left to the civil space agency.\\n\\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let\\'s not\\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\\'s build a spaceship!\"\\n\\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\\'s sponsorship, he said the\\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\\n\\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\\'\\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\\ninvestments.\"\\n\\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\\nAircraft\\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\\n\\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\\nfeet.\\n\\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\\n\\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\\n\\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\\nthrust\\n\\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\\nturnaround.\\n\\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.', u': \\n: Probably not.

Not that it really matters, the mission\\nand progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob\\nor opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited\\nevery continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.\\n\\n#  This is really a red herring. It doesn\\'t address any issue raised, but\\n#  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read\\n#  something into the Bible, doesn\\'t change what the Bible teaches.\\n\\nSigh.  \"What the Bible teaches\"?  Or: \"what the bible teaches according to\\nRobert Weiss and co.?\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by\\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\\n\\n(...)\\n\\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were \\'official doctrine.\\' I don\\'t\\n#  think that it matters if McConkie\\'s views were canon. That is not the\\n#  issue.  Were McConkie\\'s writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\\n#  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may\\n#  certainly be.\\n\\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\\nis obviously very important.  McConkie\\'s views have been controversial\\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\\nas \"McConkie\\'s Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley\\'s books!\\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

It was the religion of the great Persian\\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\\nZoroastrian prophet.\\n\\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \\na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\\npeople is very much on their minds.\\n\\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it\\'s their children - rather than\\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\\n\\n   \"It\\'s important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It\\'s important\\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\\nYou don\\'t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\\n\\n   For Zoroastrians, there\\'s much to be proud of.\\n\\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\\n\\n_Good vs. evil_\\n\\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\\n\\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\\n\\n   So it\\'s not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\\n\\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\\nwhere others had no rights.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple\\'s\\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\\n\\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\\nthis continent.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\\ncommunity center.\\n\\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \\nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \\nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\\n\\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \\nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \\na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \\ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\\n\\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\\nZoroaster\\'s birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\\n\\n  For this year\\'s celebration of the prophet\\'s birthday, about 500 people\\ncame to worship and revel.\\n\\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\\nproved him right.\\n\\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\\nand nuts.\\n\\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It\\'s a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\\n\\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\\n\\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\\n\\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\\nplayed a tambourine.\\n\\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\\n\\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\\npeople\\'s religion.\\n\\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\\n\\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\\n\\n   \"People who don\\'t have a tradition, something to lean on, what\\'s the\\ndifference with the lower animals?\"', u'\\nJesus certainly demonstrated the great depth of his love for the\\nchildren who died today at the Davidian complex.\\n\\nSorry, but the events today made me even more negative concering\\norganized religion.\\n\\nCheers,\\nKent', u\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhil> Didn't one of the early jet fighters have these?

Richard Whitcomb and R.T.

It's true that we\\nused military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but\\nthat had more to do with availability and need than with military\\ninvolvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was\\nbailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our\\nresults and supportive of our efforts.\\n\\nDryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No\\nmechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were.\\nGeneral Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how\\nsuccessful we were.

I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!  \\n\\nThe NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using\\nthem for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.

Back\\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \\nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \\nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \\nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a\\nstrong response from the West was required.\\n\\n\\nWell, it\\'s not very \"loving\" to allow a Hussein or a Hitler to gobble up\\nnearby countries and keep them.  Or to allow them to continue with mass\\nslaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  So, I\\'d have to\\nsay yes, stopping Hussein was the most \"loving\" thing to do for the\\nmost people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.\\n\\nI mentioned it.\\n\\nIf we hadn\\'t intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would\\nhave been appeasement.  It is precisely the lessons the world learned\\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.  Letting Hitler take\\nAustria and Czechoslavkia did not stop WW2 from happening, and letting\\nHussein keep Kuwait would not have stopped an eventual Gulf War to\\nprotect Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n\\nSure.  What was truly unfortunate was that they followed Hitler in\\nhis grandiose quest for a \"Thousand Year Reich\".  The consequences\\nstemmed from that.\\n\\nWhat should I say about them?  Anything in particular?\\n\\n\\n\\nSo?  It was the *policemen* on trial not Rodney King!!  And under American\\nlaw they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  If there had been black\\nofficers involved, I\\'m sure their would have been black jurors too.\\nThis point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.\\n\\n\\nSo?

So one cannot conclude either way due to\\nthe silence of the principals.  \\n\\n\\nOK.  It certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.\\nAnd frankly, the original \"not guilty\" verdict baffled me too.  But then\\nI learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict\\non a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably\\nwould have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated\\nassault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  A charge, which\\nnews commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under California\\nlaw.  Based on what the prosecution was asking for, it\\'s evident that \\nthe first jury decided that the officers were \"not guilty\".  Note, \\nnot \"not guilty\" of doing wrong, but \"not guilty\" of aggravated assault \\nwith the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  The seeds of the \\nprosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a \\nverdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.\\n\\nIf the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then\\nI feel the \"not guilty\" verdict was a reasonable one.\\n\\n\\nThanks mathew, I like the quote.

       "  u'There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn\\'t she the cutest thing!?\"\\n\\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\\nit is not.\\n\\n\\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\\nJohn E King:\\n\\n\\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\\nbe rebuilt\", and you\\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\\nto get from `fishing nets\\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\\n\\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit is hardly a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, no.  That\\'s only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I\\'m\\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\\nit\\'s at least a two-horse town.\\n\\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it\\'s still 22,000 people\\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\\n\\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwalls.\\n\\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\\n',\n",
       "  u'About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\\narea.',\n",

       "  u\"Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\\n\\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\\ncan help a little.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

In\\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \\noutwardly profess\\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\\n\\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true\\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is\\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\\nwill not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.

       "  u'Archive-name: atheism/logic\\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: logic\\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\\nVersion: 1.4\\n\\n                       Constructing a Logical Argument\\n\\nAlthough there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\\nfound is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"',\n",

No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\\ndares to venture off what is already known.

Dit jaar is het 350\\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\\n\\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\\nvieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala\\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\\n\\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\\n'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\\neen apart vel.\\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde.

De op te vangen signalen zijn\\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\\n\\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch).

       "  u\"[why do babies get diseases, etc.]\\n\\n Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably \\nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\\nhow could it exist before humans?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'\\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\\ncollective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the\\ndegeneration of the genetic code'.\\n\\n\\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to\\nbe getting less nasty w/age...\\n\\n\\n Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n\\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system\\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the\\noriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in\\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\\nof did It just choose not to?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for\\nthe explanation you give.

Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C).

       "  u'-*----\\n\\nThe two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are\\nso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael\\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\\n \\n\\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\\nloving one\\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and\\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \\n\\n\\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \\n\\n\\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \\n\\n\\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \\n\\n-*----\\n\\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \\nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\\ngospel.\\n\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\\nmake Michael\\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\\n\\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\\n\\n\\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\\n\\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\\n\\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\\n\\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\\n\\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\\n\\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\\n\\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\\n\\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\\n\\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\\n\\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\\n\\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\\n\\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\\n\\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\\n\\t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\\n\\t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously.

       "  u\"Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):\\n\\nThere will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its\\nrings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!

He might also have\\nsome money available...\\n\\nJohn Spencer, 1993/04/21\\n\\nIapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn\\nitself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,\\n(21:16-09:38 UT).

Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.

I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\\n\\n  Jay\\n\\nand again:\\n\\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.

       "  u'\\nWishful thinking mostly. It\\'s more likely that the Moon will never\\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\\nmaterials we can\\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \\nand it\\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\\'s heat \\nsink capacity could offer some military utility for \"high ground\" military\\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \\ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \\nMt.

It\\'s likely too low to prevent\\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\\'s\\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\\n\\nWe don\\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent.

The first is\\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\\nconventional warfare again.

       "  u'\\n\\nLet us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by\\nsentence.\\n\\n\\n1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.\\n\\nOrigins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\\n\\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\\n\\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\\non what origins we are talking about.\\n\\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\\n\\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \\n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\\n\\nMore to the point, restricting one\\'s discussion of origins to science\\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\\nscope of discussion.\\n\\n4) This is a false premise.\\n\\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\\n\\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God\\'s creation.\\n\\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\\n\\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\\n\\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\\nwith the following contextual modification:\\n\\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.',\n",

       "  u'Archive-name: space/probe\\nLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:19 $\\n\\nPLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS\\n\\n    This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes\\n    (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was\\n\\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\\n\\t     from surface.\\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft.

LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\\n\\t      1972.\\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon\\'s\\n\\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\\n\\t      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\\n\\t      1976.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\\n\\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\\n\\t       lost enroute in 1961.\\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\\n\\t       VENERA 3.

No images were returned.\\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\\n\\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\\n\\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\\n\\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\\n\\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\\n\\t       similar in 1969.\\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\\n\\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\\n\\t       1972.\\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\\n\\t       first probe to orbit Venus.

Flyby buses went on\\n\\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\\n\\t     March of 1986.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\\n\\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\\n\\t     enroute the following year.\\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\\n\\t     Planet in 1971.\\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\\n\\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\\n\\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\\n\\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\\n\\t     probe MARINER 9.\\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\\n\\t     with its flyby bus.\\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\\' largest\\n\\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\\n\\t       human/computer error.\\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\\n    background.

They still arm themselves to \"defend the\\n#>faith\", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a\\n#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives\\n#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their\\n#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.\\n#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy \"they,\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when\\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most of\\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"\\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like it\\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\\nappears, those of David Koresh.\\n\\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They\\'re pledged to defend\\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\\n\\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\\n\\n#\\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I\\'m taking it with a salt block.\\n\\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\\n\\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI\\'s treatment\\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\\n\\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\\nof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in the\\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\\n\\n#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\\n\\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon\\'s \"orders\" (the late\\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\\nopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile maze\\nin Utah).\\n\\n#        That\\'s my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have\\n#splinter groups that don\\'t mirror the masses, but these are small\\n#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.\\n#\\n#        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.

(818) 354-5011\\n\\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\\n\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\\n#1506\\n\\n     Scientists at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth\\'s ozone layer.\\n\\n     The April 3 flight from California\\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport\\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \\n\\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\\nDiscovery.\\n\\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.

       "  u'I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or\\nTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted\\nby a 3D scanline renderer. \\n\\nI have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but\\nhave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\\nsubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.\\n\\nThanks for any pointers.\\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n',\n",

It is even sadder that the people who\\ndied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was\\ntheir downfall to death. \\n\\nAnd Kent, don\\'t you bury yourself underneath a rock with an\\nexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.\\nDavid Koresh was no light and no excuse for\\nyou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who\\nclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh\\nwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn\\'t\\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\\n\\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\\nKoresh wasn\\'t anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \\n\\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\\nmother\\'s name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\\nright from the start.  The wouldn\\'t have followed Koresh.\\nThey wouldn\\'t have died.  But look what happened.  Their\\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\\ncost them a lot.\\n\\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \\nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \\nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus\\'s case,\\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\\ndidn\\'t work with Jesus.  \\n\\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\\nKoresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?\\nWho was Koresh\\'s teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what\\nSatan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did\\nnot Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not\\nthe cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew\\nthe real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve\\nchoose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and\\nevil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God\\nheld them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.

       "  u'The primary problem in human nature is a \"fragmentation of being.\"\\nHumans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and\\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\\n\\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\\'s\\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\\nthe Scriptures.\\n\\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\\n\\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\\n\\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\\n\\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\\n\\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\\n\\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\\n\\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it\\nwith the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the\\nanswer to his dilemma in vs 25.',\n",

       "  u'ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!\\n\\n  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, \\nether sucking structures, AND why we observe \"orbital\" motion!!\\n\\n  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic \\nwaves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the \\nMichelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago. \\n\\n  I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact \\nthat the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the \\nearth\\'s surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption \\nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\\n\\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \\ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \\nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\\n\\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\\n\\n  \\n1\\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\\n \\n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \\nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \\nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \\n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\\n\\n  The earth isn\\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \\nof a galaxy; we haven\\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \\nbeing stationary, and the sun\\'s image being dragged across the sky by \\nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \\nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \\nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \\nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \\nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \\nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\\n  \\n  The moon isn\\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \\nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\\'s ether field, which is \\nitself in the sun\\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \\nwobble of earth\\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\\' images being dragged around\\nby the sun\\'s ether feild.\\n\\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \\napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \\nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon\\'s lattice in the ether is like \\nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \\nturn. The sun\\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \\ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \\nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \\nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \\nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \\n\\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \\ncan be about as big as \"earth\\'s\" shadow upon it, and at other times \\ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \\nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \\nlook about the same size?\\n\\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\\n E       /     \\\\            \\n    M    |      |      OR                M    \\n         \\\\ _ _ /                         \\n       S                           \\n       \\n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\" \\nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\\'ve seen a \\nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \\nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon\\'s image \\nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \\nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \\nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\\n\\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \\ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \\nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \\n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \\nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \\nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\\n\\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \\nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \\na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \\ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\\n\\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\\'d \\nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \\nmight carry decipherable data. I\\'d start looking on some part of the \\nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \\nbillion humans?) I\\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \\nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \\nfor Pentium!)\\n\\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \\nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \\nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \\nI\\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \\n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \\ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \\ncould get with my machine\\'s receiver next to it.  \\n\\n  If you don\\'t think you\\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \\nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \\nlife\\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \\nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \\neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \\ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \\nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\\'m curios to see what \\nthey did and ate. Don\\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \\ndon\\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \\nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \\ndid the household concept \\'immortal\\' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \\nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \\ndie)\\n\\n  Warning about writing to the past:\\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \\nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \\nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \\nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \\nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \\nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \\n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \\nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \\nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \\nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \\nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \\ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \\nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \\nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \\nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \\nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \\nseemed odd, but we couldn\\'t remember how else it should be. Then \\nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \\nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \\nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \\nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \\nexisting only on the wind. \\n\\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \\nwhose will\\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \\nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \\nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \\nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\\'s more than one way back) \\n\\n Accepting rides to the past:\\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \\nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \\nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \\nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \\nyour work, but thinks you\\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \\npaths with your old self, and you\\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \\ncourse of history, none the wiser.\\n\\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \\nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \\nmake changes while he\\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \\nevery \\'adjustment\\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \\nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \\nBut he can\\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \\nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \\nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \\n\\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \\nour money, and they\\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \\nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \\ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \\nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \\ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \\nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \\nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \\nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \\nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \\nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \\nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \\n\\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \\nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \\nable to control.\\n\\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \\nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \\nlanguage. (telepathic; and \\'vanishing\\' the closest knowledge of death)\\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \\npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \\nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \\nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \\nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \\nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \\ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\\'t eating seeds.\\n\\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \\nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \\nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \\nneed a lot less sleep.\\n\\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \\ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \\neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\\n\\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \\ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \\nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \\nthey aren\\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \\n\\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \\nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \\nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \\nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \\nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \\nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\\n\\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \\ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \\nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He\\'ll \\nplay a poker face up until he thinks he\\'s cornered, and then he\\'ll \\nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\\'re willing to \\nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \\nright, and he didn\\'t over play his hand, and he won\\'t need to go \\nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \\nyour destiny, just don\\'t live along a path that leads to a reality \\nin which you don\\'t want to be a part of. ',\n",

       "  u'\\n\\nI assume you are posting to encourage comments - how much history has\\nTony Campello read?  Not much it seems. \\n\\n\\nIt is good to hear that there are a few reasonable Christians about.\\nIf only those christian \"scientists\" would take note.\\n\\n(In Australia there is a very strong movement, a bunch of christian \\nscientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly\\ntrue, and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified\\nby using the laws of physics.  For example, there are a few chaps who are \\ntrying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the\\nerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed \\nlight has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been \\naccounted for. :-] )\\n\\n\\nOr (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never \\nintended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one\\nup?\\n\\n\\nMillions of people have \"died for a lie\".  This  point is difficult to \\nsubstantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments\\nwork in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed \\nthemselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory\\nof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.\\n\\n  \\nThat is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)\\nto become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to\\nthe claim that Jesus was the \"real thing\".\\n\\n\\n\\nHave you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the\\npoint, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his\\nmany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based \\n(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with \\nhis principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler\\nwas sane....\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nHmmm.... I don\\'t think his arguments warrant the use of a \"Therefore...\"\\n\\n\\nThis is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with\\npeople result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think\\npeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of\\nmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to\\npresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \\n\\nTony\\'s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \\nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \"a is\\nequal to b because a is equal to b\".\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \\nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\\nclaiming to be correct.  \\n\\nIt \\n\\nI think if you posted this part to alt.religion you would get more flames\\nthan here :-).  I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments\\nof a stranger should be of interest to other people. \\n\\nSomeone famous said that there two evils in life, polititians and churchs, one\\nrules by fear of the living, the other by fear of the dead.

       "  u'\\n\\nI think the passage you\\'re looking for is the following.\\n\\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \\nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \\nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \\nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \\nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \\nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \\nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \\nheaven. \\nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \\nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \\n\\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.',\n",

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\\n\\nfaith \\n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\\nb  (1): fidelity to one\\'s promises\\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n   (2): complete trust\\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nof religious beliefs\\nsyn see BELIEF\\n\\n\\n\\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \\nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \\nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I\\'ll be \\nglad to.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \\ndisagree - it\\'s in no ones advantage to start name calling.

Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research\\nspecifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not\\nas tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am\\nnot competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns\\nout that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich \"Greek Lexicon\" renders\\neach verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical\\norder.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is\\nfar from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes\\nthings a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler',\n",

For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\\nsubject to the center tax (I don\\'t have the numbers in\\nfront of me, but I\\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\\nrate of 1/3, but it\\'s only applied to funds spent at the\\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\\n\\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\\ndoing with SSF funds that don\\'t go to the prime contractors?\\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\\'t eaten\\nup by the center tax?)\"\\n\\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\\nof the power system.\\n\\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\\n\\nAs a final example, my \\'home\\' division at Lewis used\\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \\ndatabase with information on weight of the power\\nsystem elements).\\n\\nFinally, the money raised by the \\'tax\\' does not all\\ngo into a \\'slush fund.\\' At Lewis, the director\\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\\n\\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \\'general\\'\\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \\ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \\nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\\nSSF budget doesn\\'t go for SSF activities. To get\\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\\n1 year is \\'billable\\' to SSF, would you base it on\\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\\na burecratic nightmare!',\n",

The \\ncopier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the\\nprinter with the \"lp\" system using the parallel interface and can print \\npostscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in \\nturn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a \\npublication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts \\nare less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of \\nprograms, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript \\nwith tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 \\nrather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that \\nacceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format\\nand translating the image into postscript.\\n\\nWe suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality \\npictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the \\nSCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a \\nwarranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without \\nsome assurance that the product will work.\\n\\n\\nHere my questions:\\n\\nIf anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or \\nparallel port?

Now I\\'d like to describe it in detail:\\n\\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\\nWhy not an ellipse?

In fact, for the Bible to be of\\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\\n\\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\\nwritten down by man.\\n\\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\\nhave done).\\n\\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\\nthink the important aspect is the result.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:',\n",

       "  u'\\n\\nBrian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I\\nbelieve you have not asked my god to come to you.  Why do I say this?\\nBecause by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which\\nyou write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are\\nattempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you.\\nYours doesn\\'t at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn\\'t come to you\\nbecause your god doesn\\'t exist.\\n\\n\\nI am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.\\nWhat I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.\\n\\n\\nBe true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \\nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \\nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \\nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\\n\\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \\nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\\n\\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\\n\\n\\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\\n\\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd in John 3:16:\\n\\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\\n   life.\"\\n\\n\\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn\\'t be posting\\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God\\'s church.\\n\\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\\n\\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \\nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\\n\\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn\\'t offer eternal life.\\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\\n',\n",

(THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \\n          UNIVERSES.)                             \\n\\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \\n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \\n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \\n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \\n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \\n      \\n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \\n          indicator for religious validity. \\n    \\n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \\n          other major world religions, including Islam. \\n     \\n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \\n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \\n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \\n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \\n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \\n          \"silver cord\". \\n    \\n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul\\'s cycles of \\n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \\n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \\n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \\n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \\n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \\n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \\n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \\n    \\n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \\n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \\n          Mat\" organization. \\n      \\n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \\n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \\n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \\n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \\n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \\n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \\n    \\n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \\n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \\n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \\n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \\n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \\n          classic. \\n    \\n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \\n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \\n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \\n          don\\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \\n          Jesus was. \\n    \\n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \\n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \\n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \\n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \\n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n          \\n    \\n          RE-INCARNATION\\n          \\n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \\n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \\n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \\n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \\n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \\n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \\n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \\n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \\n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \\n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \\n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \\n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \\n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \\n          \\n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \\n          typically originate from a person\\'s PAST LIVES.  For example, \\n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \\n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \\n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \\n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \\n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \\n          INCARNATION. \\n\\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \\n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \\n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \\n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \\n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \\n\\n\\n\\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\\n\\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \\n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \\n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \\n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \\n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \\n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \\n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \\n          waiting for Jesus\\' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \\n    \\n          \\n          \\n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\\n\\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \\n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \\n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \\n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \\n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \\n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \\n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \\n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \\n    \\n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \\n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \\n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \\n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \\n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \\n    \\n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \\n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \\n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \\n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \\n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \\n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \\n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \\n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\\n\\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \\n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \\n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \\n       \\n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \\n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \\n          CONTINUE. \\n    \\n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \\n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \\n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \\n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \\n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \\n          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \"SOUL TRAVEL\") \\n          REPLACE blind faith. \\n    \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (3 books, 2 addresses). \\n\\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \\n',\n",

       "  u'\\nThe number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and \\nexploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The\\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \\nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\\n\\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\\nEither the smart bombs didn\\'t hit their targets (and we know they did),\\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\\ndestroying Iraq\\'s military potential.  The military mission planners are\\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\\ntyrant-dictator. \\n\\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\\nI don\\'t hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\\nwith smart bombs, it\\'s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That\\'s war the way it really is.\\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\\nlike it\\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\\nwishes to stay free.   \\n\\n\\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\\n\\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I\\'m sure that appeasement would have\\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\\nshouldn\\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \\nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \\nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you\\'d be speaking\\nGerman instead of English right now.\\n\\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\\'t understand\\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\\nthat Bush wimped out and didn\\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so\\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\\'s sacrifice (not to\\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \\nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\\'ve been better!\\n\\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \\n\\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\\na reasonable doubt of one\\'s guilt, and only the jury is in a position\\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply\\nsuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.\\n       \\nRegards,',\n",

       "  u'\\nStop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \\nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \\nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \\nthe histories I\\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \\nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \\nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \\nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \\n1920\\'s.\\n\\n\\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \\nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\\'ve read), I\\'d like to know \\nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \\nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\\'t you write them \\nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\\'t tell from \\ntheir footnotes? I\\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\\'m not going to waste my time\\ntrying to debunk someone\\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\\n\\n\\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\\nconstitute concrete particulars?

Mitchell\\n                          March 23, 1993\\n \\nINTRODUCTION:\\n \\nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\\npurposes.\\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\\ninformation\\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\\na\\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\\n \\nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\\nand\\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\\ninterfacing\\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\\nthe\\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\\nfacility\\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\\nconstruction\\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\\nby the users themselves.\\n \\nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\\n - art and theater\\n - bbs and online network users\\n - software and game developers\\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\\n - children\\n - the child in all of us\\n \\nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\\n \\nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\\nmachine-lets.\\n \\n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\\n \\n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\\n \\nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\\ndata link to LTM1.\\n \\nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\\nSSTO\\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\\nlandscape and land.\\n \\nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\\nworldwide\\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\\ncommercially\\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\\n \\nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\\n \\nPLAN OF ACTION:\\n \\nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\\'s. A press release will be\\nissued\\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\\nmodels\\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\\n \\nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\\nbe\\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\\ntime\\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\\nto\\ntheir campus.\\n \\nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\\nwill\\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\\n \\nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\\nexperimentation\\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\\nlong\\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\\n \\nCONCLUSION:\\n \\nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\\nreal\\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\\'s minds in\\nspace.\\n \\n \\nMOONLIGHTERS:\\n \\n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\\n \\nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\\n \\nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

One of the folks involved in those\\ndiscussions, a\\nspacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to \\nsome entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with\\nit.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on \\nthe sensors that might be carried.\\n\\nActually, that sounds unlikely.  I don\\'t know what the launch vehicle\\nwould be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --\\ncertainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA\\nfor, e.g.,  launch support would probably \\ncover NASA\\'s incremental costs pretty well.\\n\\n\\nNo, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per \\nClementine and related programs.

On the other hand, it would certainly\\ndraw attention to space.   \\n\\nWhich, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.\\n\\n\\nAs far as I know, it\\'s a purely commercial venture.\\n\\nI gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.\\nCommercial projects, however, generally don\\'t get \"funding\" -- they\\nget \"customers\" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.\\n\\nNahh.

This\\nsummarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300\\nparticipants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in\\nSeville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by\\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for\\nthe Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).\\n\\nOLYMPUS has been particularly useful :\\n-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of\\n       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small\\n       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested\\n       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,\\n       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few\\n       examples.\\n\\n-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services\\n       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-\\n       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over\\n       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.\\n\\n-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS\\n       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,\\n       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and\\n       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.\\n\\nWhen OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the\\nworld\\'s largest telecommunications satellite; and no other\\nsatellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four\\ndifferent payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.\\n\\nOLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some\\nof the world\\'s largest businesses. Access to the satellite is\\ngiven in order to test new telecommunications techniques or\\nservices; over the past four years some 200 companies and\\norganisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over\\n100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning\\norganisation.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the new technologies and services tested by these\\nOLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then\\nmake use of operational satellites such as those of\\nEUTELSAT.',\n",

Until you do that you are barking in the wind.\\n\\n\\nIntegration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was \\ndone here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of\\nReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are\\ncompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There\\nis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project\\nthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for \\nApollo?\\n\\n\\nOh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.\\nThey should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it\\nreplaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your\\nbias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just\\nhow wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what\\nthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. \\n\\n\\nI agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful\\nlarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that\\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\\n\\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\\nefforts that you do not see this.\\n\\n\\nNo, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have \\nhappened in the first place.\\n\\nI have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is\\nat reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally\\nignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that\\nhas grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to \\nchange the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of\\nyour position.',\n",

Numerous studies claim that even in\\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\\n\\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\\n    pursue are:\\n\\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\\n    Salisbury in \"Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\\n    Controversy,\" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

Studies\\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\\n    study, Charles Jackman.\\n\\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\\n\\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\\n\\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Shuttle sources:\\t  725,000 kilograms/year\\n\\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\\n\\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\\n\\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\n    do at the present time.\\n\\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\\n\\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\\n    you\\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\\n\\n    References:\\n\\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\\n\\n\\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\\n\\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\\n    team\\'s medical/forensic report.\\n\\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\\n\\n\\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\\n\\n    You can\\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\\n    because it can\\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\\n\\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\\n    specialized for travel between Earth\\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\\n    spacecraft.\\n\\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\\n\\n\\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\\n\\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\\n\\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\\'t\\n    know the address) to study the Face.\\n\\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\\n    question in a few years.

According to the above poster, we must believe\\n in objects or beings that haven\\'t been proved not to exist so why stop at\\n God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan\\n except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond\\n hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can\\'t see them)  The \\n reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians\\n have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.\\n\\n\\n How did they shoot themselves in the foot?\\n\\n\\n  There is a big difference here, Stalin didn\\'t say that he stood for a \\n  particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and\\n  then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least\\n  an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this\\n  viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because\\n  one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the\\n  russians that helped Stalin that weren\\'t atheists - don\\'t they contradict\\n  your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant\\n  to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists\\n  can\\'t value life as much as theists (which you didn\\'t support).  \\n\\n\\n Ah, and here\\'s another point you didn\\'t get out of the FAQ.  An atheist\\n doesn\\'t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\\'t exist, he/she may\\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\\'s the example:\\n \\n Strong atheism - \"I believe god does not exist\"   a positive belief\\n\\n Weak atheism   - \"I don\\'t believe in a god\"       a negative belief\\n \\n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\\'s look at it this way (in sets)\\n \\n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\nweight whatsoever.',\n",

It uses freon jets for\\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\\n\\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking\\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\\n\\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \\nquantity.

       "  u\"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly\\nhad with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\\n\\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there.\\n\\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers.\\n\\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\n",

This includes things like software inspection, a\\n   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,\\n   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the\\n   project.\\n\\n4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered\\n   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this\\n   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.\\n\\n5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts\\n   are effective and certified.\",\n",

If I forgot or botched your\\nfavorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there\\'s an acronym *not*\\non this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure\\nit out, I\\'ll add it to the list.\\n\\nNote that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*\\nacronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.

All\\ncomments regarding it are welcome; I\\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.\\n\\nNote that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\\'re on your\\nown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of\\nacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that\\nare essentially always explained as they\\'re introduced are omitted.\\nFurther, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of\\nthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they\\'re simply\\ndifferent ways of referring to the same thing.\\n\\nThanks to everybody who\\'s sent suggestions since the first version of\\nthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),\\nwho is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in\\ncharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),\\nwho is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and\\nterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).\\n\\nSpecial thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA\\nReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and\\nAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly\\nmammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.\\n\\nSpecial Bonus!

SGI is committed to high\\nperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL\\nmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no\\nguarantee that your performance would be comparable.\\n\\n\\nIf your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a\\nvalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI\\nsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\\nshot.\\n\\n\\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\\n1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates\\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI\\n('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power\\nSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\\n18 months to 2 years.\\n\\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\\ndon't, we become uncompetitive.\\n\\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but\\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\\nfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\\n\\n\\nIf that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or\\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\\ncustomer base.\\n\\n\\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\\ncommitments.\\n\\n\\nFive years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor\\ntechnologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at\\nleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature\\nof the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is\\nreally 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability\\nof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.\\n\\nThere are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live\\nwith, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,\\nwe know it.\\n\\nJosh   |:-)\\n\\n-- \\n\",\n",

So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\\n##it)?  \\n##\\n\\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\\nscience.

       "  u'\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\\n\\nMAGI: \\n\\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.',\n",

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\\nSagdeev.',\n",

       "  u'\\nActually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused\\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\\'s viewpoint:\\n\\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \\n\\n\\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\\n\\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\\n\\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\\nof the Bible,) God\\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list\\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\\nperson\\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be\\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\\'s\\n\"objective\" morality for us. \\n\\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commits murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who is\\n\\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\\nseeking God\\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\\'s\\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\\nwas/is (and that\\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\\nmorality.\" ',\n",

This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all\\nthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to\\nsave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.

The tool is\\nstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind\\ncontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than\\nGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt\\nthier mind-conditioning is complete.

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation\\nInstitute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done\\nsome editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original\\nannouncement.) \\n\\nFor those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is\\nthe leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training\\nof aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe\\ndesign, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.\\nVirtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,\\nSu, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.\\n\\nI had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at\\nMAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an\\nF-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening\\nexperience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year\\nor so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to\\nsee some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines\\nfor future space craft use.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would\\nbe glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it\\'s faculty\\nhave e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the\\nreceiver to get the message.

Hopefully, you won\\'t\\nget flamed, either.\\n\\nYou will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is\\nbuilt on unsteady ground.\\n\\nFirst, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \"objective morality\". \\nMorality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a\\nperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even\\noverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.\\n\\n\\nSecond, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say,\\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\\nusing the Christian Bible?  You\\'re defeating your own purpose by doing so.\\n \\n\\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won\\'t stop the flamage.  There will always\\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\\nall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the\\nreligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,\\noverbearing totalitarianists?\\n \\n\\nHm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to\\ndiscuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I\\nstart off by saying that I think it\\'s immoral to force people to have sex with\\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don\\'t know your views on\\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\\nhave their faces uncovered.\\n\\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \\n                                                                         \\n\\n\\t(Evidence deleted)\\n\\nI\\'m not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept \"The Word\\nof God\" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for\\na person who shares your beliefs.\\n\\nStill, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could\\nbe interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.\\n\\n\\nHmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?\\n                                                      \\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot very objective. \\n\\n\\nOne could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or \"more\\ngood\" than non-beautiful people.

       "  u'There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today\\'s\\nLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\\nits competitiveness agenda.\\n\\n......',\n",

And, again, the mating\\npractices need to be reexamined...\\n\\n\\nNo, but mating practices are a special case.  I\\'ll have to think about it\\nsome more.\\n\\n\\nIndeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems\\nare not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural\\nsystem is a subset of the objective ones.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn\\'t harmful, although\\nit isn\\'t helpful either (to the mating process).  And, when you say that\\nhomosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don\\'t you mean \"bisexuality?\"\\n\\n\\nThis is standard jargon.  Read any textbook.

       "  u\"Hi everyone,\\n\\nI thought that some people may be interested in my VR\\nsoftware on these groups:\\n\\n*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******\\n\\nMultiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality\\nsystem, primarily focused on entertainment/research.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.\\n   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).\\n   Generic clients.\\n   Customizable servers.\\n   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).\\n   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).\\n   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily\\n        attached.\\n\\nFunctionality:\\n\\n  Client:\\n   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code.

But they cannot be said to be anything more than\\npersonal morals.  One thing notably lacking in most extremists is any\\nsense of _personal_ accountability - the justification for any\\nsocially unacceptable behaviour is invariably some \"higher authority\"\\n(aka, absolute moral truth).\\n\\n\\nAn objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth?\\nInteresting notion.   :-)\\n\\nCertainly one can have as one\\'s morals a belief that compromise is\\ngood.

I suppose one could hold compromise as\\nbeing an absolute moral, but then what happens when someone else\\ninsists on no compromise?  How do you compromise on compromising?\\n\\n\\nAlmost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing\\nover another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those\\naspects which justify a desired action or belief.

While that much may well be true, it is\\nincomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most\\nagressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating\\nproduction.

Be free\\nfrom all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be\\nestablished in the self.\\n  \\n                                PURPORT\\n\\n All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three\\nmodes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which\\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\\nbeginning of transcendental life.\\n\\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\\n\\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\\nBooks of A.C.

       "  u'NASA Headquarters distributed the following press\\nrelease today (4/6). I\\'ve typed it in verbatim, for you\\nfolks to chew over. Many of the topics recently\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\n\\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\\n\\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\nthe space station.\\n\\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\navailable funds.\\n\\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\nthe NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology\\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\\n\\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\nconsider.\\n\\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\n\\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\\nachieving that goal.\\n\\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"',\n",

       "  u'\\nBill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the\\nJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean\\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\\n\\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \\nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \\nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\\n\\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\\nhere.  What\\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\\nbelief is based on faith.  That\\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\\nfaith off as fact.\\n\\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\\'t a perfect canon be perfect? \\nShouldn\\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \\nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \\nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \\nan evolutionary ancestry).\\n\\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \\nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \\nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \\n\\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \\nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\\nresurrected, 4) Jesus\\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \\ncontain the first four.  \\n\\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\\n\\nIts faith, Bill.  You don\\'t have any more or better truths than anyone else. \\nWhatever works for you.  Just don\\'t foist it on others. \\n\\nRegards,',\n",

S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \"Love is the unfamiliar Name\\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\"\\n\\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\\n\\n\\nblechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one\\'s own notion of \"sin\" on\\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\\n\\n\\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\\nprohibitions.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\\n\\n\\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\\n\\t    in the Inquisition.\\n\\n\\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\\n\\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\\n\\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\\n\\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\\n\\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\\n\\n\\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\\n\\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\\n\\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\\n\\n\\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\\n\\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\\'s B,\\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\\nof charges brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, as if one\\'s theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\\nJesus\\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\\n\\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\n\\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\\nthey *aren\\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions.  The Great\\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"\\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\\n\\n\\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\nIt does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\\n\\n\\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\\n\\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\\n\\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\\'ll\\n\\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\\n\\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\\n\\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It\\nmay be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems\\n-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.\\n\\n\\nI think you are begging the question.

       "  u'[reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFor many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an\\nepistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of\\nknowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\\nbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?\\n \\nThere is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence\\nof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses\\nword \"on faith\", we just mean that having found this person to be\\nreliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.\\nIf we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence\\neverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about\\ngods?\\n \\nThe difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then\\none of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,\\nrather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith\\nis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\\nknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than\\ntheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other\\nknowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than\\nSanta Claus or the Easter Bunny?\\n \\nI would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn\\'t\\nrequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.

       "  u'I\\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\\n\\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \\nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\\nslots.\\n\\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\\nsupporting Tonga\\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \\n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \\nthe Pacific Rim. \\n\\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \\nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \\nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \\nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\n\\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \\nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\\n\\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \\nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \\nSiberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\\n\\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \\napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \\nspecifications, they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \\nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \\nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\\nnow.\\n\\nTidbits:\\n\\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\n\\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\\nwithin 9 months.\\n\\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\\n\\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\\npartly because we aren\\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\'t worry \\nbecause we\\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\nreally goes on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability as much.\\n\\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\\n\\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \\nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\\n\\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \\ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\nhardware.\\n',\n",

       "  u'\\nIt helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least\\na reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\\n\\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

He is the Prophet who is revealed\\nthe last Holy Scripture, Qur\\'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)\\nthrough the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets\\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\\'an by Allah\\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur\\'an, against the message\\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\\n\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\\n\\n----------------------\\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n\\nA   D R O P L E T\\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur\\'an\\n\\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \\nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\\n\\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\t\\t NINETEENTH LETTER  \\n\\n\\t\\t MU\\'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \\n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \\n\\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\\n\\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\\ndecree as the Glorious Qur\\'an and manifest miracles\\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n',\n",

       "  u':\\n (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the\\n  original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to\\n  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive\\n  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS \\n  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)\\n\\nSince it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin\\nof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \"no good\"\\nbecause it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not \\nthe authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time \\nbefore I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, \\nProfessor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the \\nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People\\'s magazine (Spring \\n1993 edition):\\n\\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \\n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \\n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\\n  those who don\\'t fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn\\'t draw\\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \\n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\\n  and who isn\\'t by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\\n  that the central pillar of Christ\\'s \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\\n\\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \\n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\\n\\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \\n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don\\'t like.\\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons\\' rights along with those of\\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\\n\\n\\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\\nto This People\\'s magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\\narms.  \\n\\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \\nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \\nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \\nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \\nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \\nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \\nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \\nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \\nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \\nvoice is louder.  That\\'s really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand\\non in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter \\nthe LDS Church\\' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths \\nand non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to \\ndisprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. \\nLet us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion \\nand conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.  \\n',\n",

There were\\nfrequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of\\n\"interpersonal computing\" which rejects traditional roles.\\n\\nLate-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on\\nfederal marshals.

If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.',\n",

I believe he gives such credit in Mein Kampf.\\n\\n\\nWell, I\\'m no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They\\nmake reference to several scandals that occurred long before \"the night of the\\nlong knives\". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of\\nthe SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name\\nescapes me at the moment) called \"Homosexuals in History\" asserts that Roehm\\nand Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm\\'s SA circle.\\n\\n\\nWell, you\\'re the one who is in Germany. If you don\\'t believe the history books,\\nlook up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not\\nhave access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of\\ndocumented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the \"knight of the\\nlong knives\" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping\\ntogether, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA\\'s\\nhomosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I\\'ve \\nread make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. \\n\\n\\nI know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do\\nyou know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have\\nread concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that \\nall historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about \\nhomosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don\\'t you think they \\nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?\\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \\nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. \\n\\n\\nIf you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),\\nthen the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where\\nthe stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to\\narchival material - most people on the net are not.\\n\\n\\nEh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so\\nthat you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis\\nmight have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is\\ntrue? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?\\n\\nI don\\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were\\nhomosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\\'s friends\\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \\nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \\nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \\nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \\nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\\'t have the time. Nothing is\\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.',\n",

       "  u'I\\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \\ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \\nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\\n\\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \\n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\\nIllinois. Mr Nelson\\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \\nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \\nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\\'t think the details\\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\\nthey aren\\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\\n\\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \\nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\\n                  ______\\n3 G         /|   /      |\\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \\n          /  | /        |\\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\\n       /                |          the graph wasn\\'t up for very long.\\n1 G   /                 |\\n                        |\\n                        |\\n0 G                     |\\n\\n             ^          ^\\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\\n\\n\\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \\nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \\naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\\nout entirely.\\n\\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \\nthat desired.\\n\\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\\n\\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\\n    all at once?\\n\\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\\n\\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\\n\\nA:  Can\\'t tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good \\n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \\n\\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\\n\\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \\nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\\'s reentry profile about \\n60 degrees south latitude.\\n\\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\\'t know about that\\naspect of the flight profile.\\n',\n",
       "  u'What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and\\nthe algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which\\nrequires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns\\nwhether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn\\nmethod.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several\\ncomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the\\ntransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the\\nscreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My\\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

A man was killed and five others seriously wounded in an explosion in \\nNabatiye.\\n---\\n  An Israeli navy patrol boat attacked and sank a rubber guerrilla boat off\\n\\nsouthern Lebanon early today, killing the two men aboard, the army command \\nsaid.\\n  \\n     It said in a communique that a Dvora patrol boat opened fire on the \\nmotorized rubber dinghy north of Tyre after identifying it as hostile. The\\narmy \\nsaid no one on the Israeli boat was injured. The affiliation of the slain \\nguerrillas was not immediately known.\\n---\\n  Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist mastermind Abu\\nNidal \\nbattled Sunday in Tyre, Lebanon, with machine guns and rocket-propelled \\ngrenades, killing at least four people and wounding 15, police said.\\n---\\n Lebanon's mainstream Shiite Muslim militia said Thursday that it had \\nuncovered a network of tunnels in a southern Lebanese village where it said\\npro-\\nIranian kidnappers had held Western hostages.\\n  \\n     Officials of the militia, Amal, led local journalists through the\\ncatacomb-\\nlike alleys and showed them two cells with iron doors at the village, \\nKawthariyet al Siyad, near Tyre, the ancient port city, about 40 miles\\nsouth of \\nBeirut.\\n  \\n     The officials said they were certain that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William\\nR. \\nHiggins was detained there shortly after he was seized by gunmen on a road \\noutside Tyre in February 1988.\\n--------------\\n...anyway, I counted 20 articles during these 3 years of reporting. I also\\nfound out the possible reason why the numbers for the inhabitants of the\\ncity is defined between 14000 and 24000. It seems that Tyre is one of the\\nplaces\\nwhere people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so\\nthere's\\na constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned\\nthousands of people entering and leaving this place).\\n\\nI counted 0 articles for my home town, Kristinestad, so from now I will\\nconsider this place to be a fishing village :-).\\n\\nCheers,\\nKent\\n\",\n",

It didn't require gov't to\\nfund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit\\nat the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.\\nBut there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount\\nof money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.\\n  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,\\nand large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask\\nme for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I\\ncan't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by\\nexisting space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and\\nwe are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries\\nwill be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to\\nstart them, etc.\\n\",\n",

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\\n\\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\\n\\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\\nindex is near the optimal level.\\n\\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\\n\\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC',\n",
       "  u'-------------------------------------\\n\\t+ ............The OTIS Project \\'93  +      \\n\\t+ \"The Operative Term Is STIMULATE\" + \\n\\t-------------------------------------\\n\\t---this file last updated..4-21-93---\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS OTIS?\\n\\nOTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork\\nand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    \\nand distribution.  Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.

In fact, it is the combination of the two\\nstatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to\\ncharacterize that as \"ignoring\" the instruction to spread the\\nword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.\"\\n\\nOf course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of \"instruction\\nto spread the word.\"\\n\\nAll these quotes btw are from:\\n\\nMessage-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>\\n\\n\\nAnd I claim it correctly, because my question went:\\n\\n\"Do you, too, measure\\nthe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not\\na whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?\"\\n\\nand the closest Dean came to an answer was:\\n\\n\"Peter, Peter, Peter.  You\\'re just so stupid, pretentious, dull,\\nand generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that\\nthe sport is all there is.\"\\n\\nOf course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts\\nin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,\\nyet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:\\n\\n\"So I now restore the answer to your question\\nthat you deleted.  If you\\'re still unable to figure it out, ask\\na nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really\\ndoesn\\'t take much sophistication to understand.\"\\n\\nOn top of which, I doubt that the \"answer\" is at all representative\\nof Dean\\'s true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus\\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean\\'s \\nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\\nOne wonders whether Dean\\'s mind is so warped as to find sport in all\\nthis.\\n\\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthe \"sins\" of other individuals.\"\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one\\'s sins.\\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\\n\\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\\n\\nDean again:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself\\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\\n\\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\\n\\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \\nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\\n\\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\\nthe basis of one insult after another.',\n",

I purposely used \"handle\" in order to \\navoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are\\naberrations like \"scientific\" creationism).  I used \"best\" in part to indicate \\nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\\nseems to argue over what.\\n\\n\\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\\'m not\\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \\nthink the masses can\\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \\nincapable; they just don\\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \\nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \\nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \\ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \\nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \\nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \\nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \\n\\n\\nNo.  In fact, I don\\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \\nIsn\\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \\ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \\npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \\nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\\'t\\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\\'s a tough one for\\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \\nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \\nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \\nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \\nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \\nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \\nconvoluted here; I hope I\\'ve made sense.  \\n\\n\\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \\nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \\nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \\nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \\nnaturalists\\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \\nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuch obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn\\'t it?

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment.

But they have been systematically \\n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \\n\\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

(Why should\\n: >he be deceptive just with Tyre?)\\n\\n: So, Archer is just sitting around, rubbing his hands and plotting how next\\n: to deceive?  OK, lets _see_ the list...\\n\\nThis was an open question.  I assumed that if Mr. Archer is a chronic\\nliar, someone whould have documented it.

       "  u'Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\\ndeployed by the inflatable \\'frame\\'.\\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\\'s\\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\\'s\\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \\'unit\\' cost\\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\\n  \\nBut back to Brian\\'s questions:\\n  \\n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\\'t piggy back upon\\nsomeone else\\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\\nlaunch.  That\\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\\'t think the\\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\\nand no, I don\\'t really like the idea of this additional light\\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\\nidiot?)\\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\\'s in a low\\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\\'s the time\\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\\'t heard of any serious funding\\nfor this, but I\\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\\n  \\n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\\nmy guest.  I don\\'t have posting privileges to that area (or at least\\nI don\\'t THINK I do...).\\n -------------------------------------------------------------------\\n Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor',\n",

       "  u\"Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \\nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\n\\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\n\\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\nof atmospheres.\\n\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\n\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\n\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\nto follow the projectiles.\\n\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\n\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\n\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\nsized payloads into space.

       "  u'This kind of argument cries for a comment...\\n\\n\\n \\n: >>...God did not create\\n: >>disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns.\\n: > \\n: >>What God did create was life according to a protein code which is\\n: >>mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of\\n: >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\\n: >>perfect and without flaw. \\n: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\\n\\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\\nof this statement, shouldn\\'t we?\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\\n: scientific perspective, just different.\\n\\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \\ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\\n \\n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\\n: but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\\n\\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\\n\\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\\nmore important than we\\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \\n \\n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\\n\\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \\n\\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\\n\\nI\\'d replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \\ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\\nevolve.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry I can\\'t give any references, this is based on the course\\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \\n\\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \\n\\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \\n\\nI can understand Scott\\'s reaction:\\n\\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\\n: > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what \\n: > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME\\n: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  \\n: \\n: In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.\\n: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you\\n: cannot *know* that.\\n\\nI hope you don\\'t forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests \\neverything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against\\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \\nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \\nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\\nand not to present one\\'s own conclusions prior to this. \\n\\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\\n\\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \\n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \\n: >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\\n: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\\n: >>diseases/disorders.\\n\\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \\nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn\\'t make it \\nto the present. \\n\\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven\\'t seen much evidence for either\\nclaim.\\n \\n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\\n: answering John\\'s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God\\'s fault? (the original\\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\\n\\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god\\'s fault.  But your explanation does\\nnot work, it fails miserably.\\n \\n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don\\'t know that\\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\\n: \\n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\\n: that affect mankind?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\\n\\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\\n: Actually what you\\'ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the\\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\\n: universe.\\n\\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\\n\\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\\n  \\n: Oh, I admit it\\'s not perfect (yet).  But I\\'m working on it.  :)\\n\\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\\n\\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don\\'t explain\\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\\n\\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\\nthese books.\\n\\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\\n \\n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\\n: of biology and genetics, although I\\'m sure I\\'d find it a\\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\\n: environment.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,\\nand no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.\\nIt can come into existence without a Supreme Being.\\n\\nTry reading P.W.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

       "  u'Tony-\\n\\nI read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other\\ntypical\"Christian\" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\\'s great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\\nin the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually\\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I\\'ve\\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\\n\\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\\noppressive legisation against gays.\\n\\nPerhaps you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God\\'s will be done as they massacred thousands\\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\\n\\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. This is\\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\\nwill \\'naturally\\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\'s expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\\nsomething very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedrooms.  It\\'s funny that most straight people have successfully\\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminals.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\'s pastors arrested for self-\\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\\nColorado has created an organization who\\'s posters are appearing all over\\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\\nembracing.\\n\\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntowards those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\\nexcluding people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin\\'s books and find them quite helpful,\\nespecially concerning \\'cults.\\' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\\nitself.  Why don\\'t we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people\\nto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?\\n\\nWhatever',\n",

Obviously you keep to the\\n: Monty Python song:  \"Every sperm is sacred\".  And if, as *you* say, it has\\n: a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own \\n: arguement, natural.\\n\\nConsider the context, I\\'m talking about an evolutionary function. One\\nof the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a\\nspecies procreate, those who don\\'t have no purpose in that context.\\n\\n: \\n: |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to\\n: |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must\\n: |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a\\n: |> family.

Also the parent from single\\n: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,\\n: by your arguement, die.\\n\\nBy your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your\\nsecond point, you prove again that you have no idea what context\\nmeans. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,\\nthe fundamental premise of the whole process.\\n: \\n: |> But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually\\n: |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social\\n: |> abberation as well.

But wait, there\\'s\\n: |> more.\\n: |> \\n: \\n: Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with\\n: the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\\n: These days is just ain\\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \\n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\\'s sex &c (but that\\'s \\n: another arguement...) so it\\'s more of a \"lifestyle\" decision.  Again by\\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \\n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\\n\\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\\nhomosexuals don\\'t procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\\n\\n: \\n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\\n: |> choice that should be protected by law.

I am not\\ntelling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments\\nagainst the practice of homosexuality (providing it\\'s a merely an\\nalternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably\\ncall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize\\nof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,\\nand that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you\\nare to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.\\n: \\n: |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to\\n: |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of\\n: |> the homosexual \"life-style\".
