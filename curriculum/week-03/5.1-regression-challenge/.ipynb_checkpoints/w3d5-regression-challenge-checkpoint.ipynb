    "- **university_name** - name of university.\n",
    "- **country** - country of each university.\n",
    "- **teaching** - university score for teaching (the learning environment).\n",
    "- **international** - university score international outlook (staff, students, research).\n",
    "- **research** - university score for research (volume, income and reputation).\n",
    "- **citations** - university score for citations (research influence).\n",
    "- **income** - university score for industry income (knowledge transfer).\n",
    "- **total_score** - total score for university, used to determine rank.\n",
    "- **num_students** - number of students at the university.\n",
    "- **student_staff_ratio** - Number of students divided by number of staff.\n",
    "- **international_students** - Percentage of students who are international.\n",
    "- **female_male_ratio** - Female student to Male student ratio.\n",
    "- **year** - year of the ranking (2011 to 2016 included).\n",
