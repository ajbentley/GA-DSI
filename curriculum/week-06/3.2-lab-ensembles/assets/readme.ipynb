    "\n",
    "In this lab we will compare the performance of a simple Decision Tree classifier with a Bagging classifier. We will do that on few datasets, starting from the ones offered by Scikit Learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have learned, data science is an iterative process. We often start with a very simple model and then try to improve its performance or find better models to compare with our initial one.\n",

    "This is exactly the process that you will follow in this lab. Start from a simple model (Decision Tree) and then compare its performance with a more complex Ensemble model.\n",

    "We will use two dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- for classification we will use the [Breast Cancer Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) as an example of classification. We will try to diagnose a breast cancer starting from few features of the cell nucleus\n",
    "\n",
    "- for regression we will use the [Diabetes Dataset](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/LARS/LeastAngle_2002.pdf), where we'll try to obtain a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline from 10 baseline variables."
