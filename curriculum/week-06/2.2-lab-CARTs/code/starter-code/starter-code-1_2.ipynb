    "\n",

    "- For every single predictor, examine every possible cutpoint, and choose the predictor and cutpoint such that the resulting tree has the **lowest possible mean squared error (MSE)**. Make that split.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We could define a stopping criterion, such as a **maximum depth** of the tree or the **minimum number of samples in the leaf**.\n",
    "2. We could grow the tree deep, and then \"prune\" it back using a method such as \"cost complexity pruning\" (aka \"weakest link pruning\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 2 involves setting a tuning parameter that penalizes the tree for having too many leaves. As the parameter is increased, branches automatically get pruned from the tree, resulting in smaller and smaller trees. The tuning parameter can be selected through cross-validation.\n",
