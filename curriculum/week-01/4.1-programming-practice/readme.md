## Opening and Review (5 mins)

Over the last few days we've gone over quite a bit of python.

- Integers, floats, strings
- Arithmetic operators, string operators
- Variable assignment
- Lists and dictionaries, operations on both
- If, if/else, loops, functions
- Iteration, libraries

There are four exercises in iPython notebooks within the starter-code folder to help you review and challenge your python coding abilities. They vary in difficulty.
