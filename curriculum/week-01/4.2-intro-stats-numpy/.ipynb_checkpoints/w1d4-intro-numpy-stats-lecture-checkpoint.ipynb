    "There are two main approaches in statistics: **descriptive** and **inferential**. Right now, we'll focus on basic descriptive statistics: describing, summarizing, and understanding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measures of central tendency** provide descriptive information about a single numerical value 'typical' of the values of a quantitative variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're probably already familiar with some of these summary measures: the **mean**, **median**, and **mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also discuss **skewness**, which is the lack of symmetry in a distribution of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we'll take a look at measures of variability: namely the **range**, **variance**, and **standard deviation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **NumPy** library has functions to calculate all of these, but before we let NumPy do the work, let's be sure we can apply these fundamental concepts by hand.\n",
