#### Requirements

Using the [data set for Project 2](./assets/datasets/billboard.csv):
- load it
- convert data types if necessary
- clean it
- calculate summary stats, like: mean, median, mode, std, variance, range

Look at the requirements for Project 2. Begin brainstorming what your research question might be. Think of how you might approach that problem, and how you may need to transform the dataset to answer it. Do you need to add features? Do you need to create features that are based on combinations of other columns? Will it be helpful to have statistics based on subsets of this data?
