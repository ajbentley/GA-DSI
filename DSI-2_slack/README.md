This is a VERY dirty download of what's been on our slack channels.

The files are poorly labeled and poorly organized, but I'll try to clean it up over the next [insert unreasonably optimistic estimate of how long this would take me to get around to and then to do].

Feel free to fork and work on meanwhile, or to add.

Eventually I'll also probably push this up to my site in some form, so if there's something on here that you'd rather not, definitely let me know that.

Also, nothing that was in your private chats is here, so if you've got anything you'd like to share (with the consent of others in those private chants, natch) please do.
