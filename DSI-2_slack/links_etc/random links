My sis just sent me this helpful dataset that gives attributes for every day between 2000-2020. Very useful for anyone working with dates in their project!

https://segmentationsolutions.nielsen.com/mybestsegments/Default.jsp?ID=70
With PRIZM, Nielsen broke with traditional clustering algorithms to embrace a new technology that yields better segmentation results. PRIZM was created by a proprietary method developed by Nielsen statisticians called Multivariate Divisive Partitioning (MDP). MDP borrows and extends a tree partitioning method that creates the segments based on demographics that matter most to households’ behaviors.
The most common tree partitioning technique, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), involves a more modeling-oriented process than clustering. Described simply, statisticians begin with a single behavior they wish to predict and start with all participating households in a single segment. Predictor variables, such as income, age, or presence of children, are analyzed to find the variable—and the appropriate value of that variable—that divides the single segment into two that have the greatest difference for that behavior. Additional splitting takes place until all effective splits have been made or the size of the segment created falls below a target threshold.

it’s like wu-tang style but on the phone with a recruiter, so essentially totally different than wu-tang style

@channel for documentation reading practice, there’s an optional morning exercise in the repo: the challenge is to quickly reproduce a specific example with a brand new library. for those interested, after lunch we can talk through documentation and troubleshooting tactics. (you requested this lesson a few weeks ago, but not sure how many people still need it!)

[11:12]
also: i have 1-2 available slots for technical interview practice. sign up by yelling something at me on slack, first come first served.

[11:15]
and apologies, i forgot to update the calendar. we’re doing A/B testing this afternoon!

What are Convolutional Neural Networks and why are they important?
Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are a category of Neural Networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. ConvNets have been successful in identifying faces, objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self driving cars.

Student's t-test
A t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. It can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other.
A t-test is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known. When the scaling term is unknown and is replaced by an estimate based on the data, the test statistics (under certain Show more… (18KB)

Quoted from the above ...

apohn 1 day ago [-]

Background: I currently lead a Data Science team at a big non-tech company. Previous to this I worked at a software company that had a Data Science team in their customer facing consulting group.
I'm going to speak primarily about applied data science. This means a data scientist who is solving a business need by doing ad-hoc analysis or building a reusable solution (e.g a R+Shiny dashboard) to a business problems.
Jobs: There are plenty of jobs out there, but you have to be careful. Many "Data Science" jobs are really BI, Business Analyst, or Sales Engineer types of jobs where some VP got it in their head that they need a Data Scientist. These jobs are great for people who are okay with Technology and Data Science being 10% of their job - and many people are like that. They don't care about engineering, coding, or tech and statistics beyond the minimum to do their jobs. But if you really want a job that involves solid tech and stats/ML skills you will be unsatisfied at these types of jobs.
Right now there are plenty of hard business problems that people want to turn into Data Science problems because they think it'll give them a competitive edge or something to market and show off. This results in more data science job openings. However, they are not really data science problems. As somebody else said, people will eventually realize they are not getting the value they need with data scientists doing these types of jobs. Then they'll replace that person with an MBA with some DS coursework (e.g. MBA who can use KNIME or SAS Enterprise Miner) or eliminate the position.
People: I interview people and I know people at other organizations who interview candidates for Data Science roles. MOOCs and many degree programs (including 2 year MS degrees) are pushing out people who have a very superficial overview of data science. Basically they teach them about every ML algorithm in the known universe and the functions to call them them in R/Python/SAS. The end result is a mediocre coder or non-coder who boils everything down to a confusion matrix or root mean squared error. But they cannot actually think through a business problem or see why a low error doesn't equal a good model (see http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)
Finding good people is hard and you have to be flexible to realize great people can come from different backgrounds.
--AND--
This thread is really depressing as someone currently going through a bootcamp. (dataquest) Is it more realistic to aspire for data engineering/analyst roles?

that was a pretty pessimistic thread. my 2 cents: people aren’t actually talking about the market demand for data scientists, they’re arguing about what a data scientist is, and getting granular about the different kinds of roles and work scenarios in the data science space. so use that knowledge to help inform what to apply to and how to pitch yourself for different roles.

alex.combs [2:40 PM]
Lot of sound and fury that basically says the value is in solving business problems which shouldn't really be surprising

winston [2:45 PM]
where are the shakespeare emojis

alex.combs [3:14 PM]
Close enough
