# Student Code of Conduct

General Assembly is a community of learners. Should a student be disruptive to the community, he or she may
be asked to leave. Examples of disruption include, but are not limited to, aggression or threats towards other
students, instructors, or staff; illegal activities conducted or discussed on or around campus; the failure to
observe classroom or campus conduct standards set forth by instructors or staff; or other behavior identified as
disruptive to the learning environment of other students by instructors or staff.

Students are to treat all members of the staff and other students with respect and dignity. A student who is
caught cheating; willfully destroying school property; attending school under the influence of illegal drugs and/
or alcohol; or exhibiting disruptive, insubordinate, boisterous, obscene, vulgar, or disrespectful behavior may
be dismissed and prohibited from re-enrollment in another course. Students dismissed due to disruptive and/or
disrespectful conduct will not be re-admitted to General Assembly
