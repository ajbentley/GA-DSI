> Note: The following is a Markdown formatted readme file of [this Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10MQB-CR_IQl3-z1HpxGKCrScKb94uj53FvQkssX9KBw/edit?usp=sharing) that is sent to students by production teams upon signing up for the course.

## REQUIRED TOOLS
Before the course starts, you may want to familiarize yourself with the following technologies:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - We will be using Anaconda as our primary development environment
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - We will be using Python & its packages as our primary language
* [Github](http://github.com) - We’ll be using Github on a daily basis to store and share our code
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - You will also need to install and configure command line tools for Git
* [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) - We’ll be using Postgres for local SQL-based data storage
* [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/) is a popular dashboard creation system for visualizing data.
* [Slack](http://slack.com) - We’ll be using Slack on a daily basis to communicate with each other

## COMMON TOOLS
Anaconda bundles many of the Python packages we’ll be using, including:

* **Python 2.7**: One language to rule them all...
* **Ipython / Jupyter**  & **Pandas**: Core tools for notebooks & data analysis.
* **Matplotlib**: The king of all python plotting packages.
* **Gensim**: Framework for vector modeling.
* **NLTK** & Spacy**: Used for natural language processing.
* **NumPy**: Array processing tool.
* **Scikit-learn**: Modules for machine learning & data modeling.
* **SciPy**: Scientific library for python.
* **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualizer.
* **Pip** & **Setuptools**: package installer & version manager (Mac only).
* **PyMC**: common stats tool for simulation and optimization.
* **Sqlite**: Standalone, lightweight SQL database engine.
* **Statsmodels**: Simple statistical computation (used with SciPy).

## ADDITIONAL TOOLS
These tools aren't specifically required, but are highly recommended.

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) are popular text editors for writing scripts to process data, perform analysis, and create visualizations.
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is Google's popular web browser, and comes with a complete set of developer tools built-in.
* [Import.io](https://www.import.io/): a useful web scraping tool with a graphic interface.
* [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly): a user-friendly tool for plotting graphs.

## A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
Read the notes below to make sure your machine will work for DSI:

#### System Requirements
Make sure your machine is running with administrator permissions and has **at least 10-20 GB of free disk space**. We also recommend that you use a laptop with a **13-inch screen or larger** in order to do your best work. In our experience, students with an 11-inch screen have a harder time in class.

#### Mac Users
General Assembly is a Mac-friendly organization.  Our instructors will be teaching the course using Macs, so we **strongly recommend students use a Mac with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or greater** in order to run all of the programs necessary for the course. This rules out some older MacBooks versions (circa 2006-2007). 

Check the following specs to make sure your machine can provide you with the performance you’ll need in this course:

* *1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor*
* *Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz*
* *Intel HD Graphics 6000*
* *At least 8GB RAM*
* *128GB flash storage*
* *10-20 GB of free disk space*

#### PC Users
While you can be a data scientist with any machine, unfortunately, there are a number of compatibility issues with our Python libraries and most versions of Windows. 

That’s why we require our Windows users to *install a Virtual Machine in order to run a Linux environment*. This allows all of our students and instructors to use the same UNIX-based commands when working on class materials. Prior to the start of the course, we’ll send you instructions on how to [install Linux + Ubuntu as part of our custom DSI “Installfest” walkthrough](./installfest-lesson/readme.md).

Please note that our instructors will be conducting the course using Macs, and may not be able to help you troubleshoot any issues you might encounter with a Linux environment.  If you choose to use a PC + Linux, **you will need to provide your own IT support.**
