## DATA SCIENCE IMMERSIVE

Congratulations on joining the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly! We can’t wait to get started, so we’ve outlined a few assignments to get everyone on the same page. These onboarding tasks will prepare you to hit the ground running, and are ***due by the first day of class***. As always, let us know if you have any questions. Have fun and we’ll see you soon!

### WHAT CAN I EXPECT FROM THE ONBOARDING?

Your onboarding tasks include a number of **required** and **optional** tutorials to help you review the fundamentals of *stats*, *python*, *SQL*, *git*, and the *command line*. These are accompanied by a set of **multiple-choice challenges** that assess whether you’ve fully grasped the concepts that you’ve learned. 

There are time estimations under each module but depending on your background and familiarity with these topics, you may spend more or less time on each part. 

#### If you find yourself thinking…

         “This stuff is way too easy, is this course actually going to challenge me?”

The purpose of these tasks is to make sure that everyone starts the course on the same page. If you are speeding through this material, you’re in a great place to start the course, and we’ve included bonus material for you to work through. Don’t worry, you’ll be challenged in this course - we like to take it slow in the beginning but will ramp up fast!

         “This stuff is way too hard, am I going to be able to keep up?”

That’s why you’re doing these assignments in the first place - so that you can get up to speed! We’ll be reviewing these concepts in the first week as well so if you don’t get it now, you’ll have a chance to fully catch up by the end of the first week of class. 

### A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY 

You’ll need an account with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) to complete these assignments. Go ahead and take 5 minutes to create accounts if you don’t have them already.

Additionally, before the course starts, we’ll provide you with directions on how to install the following technologies: 

 * [Github](http://github.com) - We’ll be using Github on a daily basis to store and share our code
 * [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - We will be using Python & its packages as our primary language
 * [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - We will be using Anaconda as our primary development environment
 * [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) - We’ll be using Postgres for local SQL-based data storage
 * [Slack](http://slack.com) - We’ll be using Slack on a daily basis to communicate with each other
